A small village along the [Kohoii River](Kohoii%20River%20232c5cb610f580879a2cd9e12dfb5efd.md) in the southeast. It is surrounded by woods, and is nearby the border of the expansionist kingdom of [Solei](Solei%20a43736a3946f491ab5b40ad8e7fab381.md). The village has been in Solei’s sights for a very long time, leading to tense relations between the two.

## Generic
### Demographics
Kohoii is a small village of approximately 50-70 [[SPECIES/Selhae/index\|Selhae]]. 

### History
Kohoii was one of the original Selhae settlements made by the first generation of Selhae. It was founded by three Selhae, who went on to form the three *gaelii* - **Levenkagaelii**, **Daerikagaelii**, and **Gahinukagaelii**.

### Government
Kohoii is a very traditional Selhae settlement, meaning it is comprised of 3 overarching “*gaelii*” (families) - with the elder of each gaelii representing them in the [[ORGANIZATIONS/Kohoii Council of Elders/index\|Kohoii Council of Elders]]. These Elders are currently:

#### Council Elders
- **[Reika](Reika%20c3f81d2257d84c019e43faa2f13a035c.md) of the Levenkagaelii**
    - [Esela](Esela%207a0dac9b9d0f422489c6e9609eef84a6.md) is next in line.
    - [Naediia](Naediia%20dc678366936e41f384da240a61708663.md) was meant to be the next elder (and would be around the same age as the other elders) before her death.
    - She is the oldest of the elders, the last elder of her generation.
    - Reika is extremely traditionalist, strict, and does not like to compromise.
- **[Paeyiilos](Paeyiilos%20232c5cb610f58053b867dfaa978e0bb3.md) of the Daerikagaelii**
    - [Soren](Soren%20210c5cb610f58063bfb8e9e4db45c7f5.md) is next in line.
    - Paeyiilos is more of a free spirit than Reika, less traditional.
- **[Miire](Miire%20232c5cb610f580769940f81f708307a6.md) (and [Mare](Mare%20232c5cb610f580e4ae12c46dffb70eb7.md)) of the Gahinukagaelii**
    - Miire is the effective elder, being the older twin, but Mare assists their twin and will take over in the event something happens to Miire.
    - The two are joined at the hip and never leave each others sides, but tend to butt heads often in their ideals.


The gaelii are not always related by blood, and tend to be larger than traditional families. Generally the elder of a gaelii will choose the next elder for their gaelii, and it is typically the current elder’s eldest child. However, it is not uncommon for the elder title to be transferred horizontally as well, for example passing the title to a sibling, cousin, or even close friend.

Overall, the whole village is very tight knit as well, and even people from other gaelii tend to be considered “family”.

### Geography
The village lays along the Kohoii river, with most of the homes and shops on the west side of the river while the east side of the river holds the villages farmland.

The west side of the river is wooded, while the east side of the river is less tree-covered and leads into the plains further east. These plains made for easier farming, so the east side of Kohoii is mostly dedicated to agriculture - though the farmers do have homes on the farms as well.

Kohoii is a day’s travel from [[LOCATIONS/Raevat/index\|Raevat]], a village to the east within the kingdom of Solei, and about a week’s travel from [[LOCATIONS/Yuvomne/index\|Yuvomne]], a larger independent settlement located further north along the river.

In the wooded west side of Kohoii, there is a village center where there are a few shops, an inn, and an amphitheater, as well as the council house. 

Outside of the village center, a few homes within close proximity of each other, as well as more spread out homes with more land dedicated to them the further you go out from the center. 

The homes themselves tend to be small cottages, made of stone and wood.

There are two bridges across the river: one stone bridge at the village center where the river is wider, and a smaller, wooden bridge further north where the river narrows.
