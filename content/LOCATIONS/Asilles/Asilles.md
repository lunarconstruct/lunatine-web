### History

Asilles began as a [World Seed](World%20Seed%2079ce63c075c84da084bc3ad1f11cab5e.md) planted in the [World Garden](World%20Garden%205a6cfe0468e64efe8e9b097f621b0ca2.md), just as any planet did. Its caretakers, [Anwi](Anwi%20af7e2c72103f45cdbee264ff6beb0e57.md) and [Wefa](Wefa%200d386a3f0d714b369130ebed9c6f58cd.md), had been partners for a very long time.

As the world seed grew, life began to sprout - beautiful plant life and animals sprung up all across the planet. Anwi and Wefa decided that they had so much love for this planet, that they would gift to it sentient life as well. Anwi created the [Selhae](Selhae%20822e316012e74ddba8bb5c6faf31fe66.md), and Wefa created the [Fae](Fae%200d82fa7326324372a247af4a753935ff.md) - two sides of the same coin. They each had [Soul](Soul%20f5650c5d3be2487194e629cc898ca601.md)s, but each worked in a different way, with the Selhae working inwards towards the core of the soul, and the Fae working outwards towards the elements.

Life prospered on Asilles for a very long time. Societies began, grew, and fell many times over. Eventually, Anwi and Wefa noticed the [Dust](Dust%20e5dd6dcde4974c6ca3920c91cad7c2cb.md) within the planet beginning to wane. It is part of the natural cycle of a planet - from seed, to world, and finally to a fully bloomed, newly born [Inna](Inna%2099642857c4464973a4612f6533cb754d.md). The caretakers knew this would come eventually - it is what they set out to do in the first place. However, Anwi and Wefa had gotten more attached to the life on their planet than most Inna tend to.

While most Inna see the world as a means to an end, just a step in the life cycle of the Inna, Anwi and Wefa saw it unfair that the people of Asilles would have to perish in order for them to create the new life they set out to create in the beginning. As the next, and last cycle of life began on Asilles, Anwi and Wefa created a plan.

From each of the 4 moons circling the planet - [Kuraesmeris](Kuraesmeris%2039c7d3756b5b49399f2860c0862ed433.md), [Hiitomeris](Hiitomeris%2085a97d5712054feb93bd85039bd30e18.md), [Buromeris](Buromeris%2029c63ca0b6ff4a84b552d1cb685727b1.md), and [Folmeris](Folmeris%20f226aba3a51c4922911907e803b1cb60.md) - the caretakers took a stone and embedded it into an artifact they called the [Moonband](Moonband%2091567d1e97bb4b53be7fc62690dab52f.md). From this moonband, they constructed a guardian of sorts - a construct of Moon - [Merisdae](Merisdae%2096ee77d2a5d24d1aa718c98ca012d365.md). 

Then, from the starlight that illuminated the planet, they created a gem of starlight. From this gem, they made a construct of Starlight - [Yudora](Yudora%20e048ec27657b44fcac23ffb26bece1ab.md).

Merisdae and Yudora’s task would be to watch over the people of Asilles until the planet’s end truly came. When the end was near, Merisdae would choose a Selhae to guide the people from Asilles to the moons, and Yudora would choose a Fae fit to assist with cultivating life on these moons.
