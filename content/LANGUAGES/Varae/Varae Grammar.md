## **phonotactics**

1. syllable structure is (c)v(c).
2. onset can be any sound.
3. coda can be any sound but <**y**> or <**w**>.
4. <**s**> next to a voiced consonant often becomes /**z**/.
5. no <**i**> next to another vowel. if an <**i**> falls next to a vowel, a <**y**> will emerge between them.
6. repeated consonants/vowels, like <**oo**> or <**dd**> or <**aeii**> always drop the extra sound when part of the same word.
7. when a word with a coda consonant combines with a word lacking an onset consonant, the coda of the first always moves into the onset of the second.

# **sentence structure**

## word order
word order in varae is SOV (subject-object-verb).
adjectives are placed before their respective noun, and that extends to adjectival clauses and phrases. adpositions, however, are placed after the noun.
adverbs are placed after the verb, and that extends to adverbial clauses and phrases as well.

```gloss
\num 1
\ex deii kuraesa meris fa vaesii
\gla deii kuraesa meris fa vae-sii
\glb 3SG beautiful moon at look-PRS
\glc SUBJECT (adj) OBJECT (adp) VERB
\ft She looks at the beautiful moon.
```
```gloss
\num 2
\ex vaii siibte asu sokaso mosa
\gla vaii siibte asu soka-so mosa
\glb 1SG ground to fall-PAS down
\glc SUBJECT (adp) VERB
\ft I fell down to the ground.
```

## questions

question sentences are marked with the `sem` particle placed at the end of the sentence.

```jsx
"koii vaiivaii haeyase suran sem"
koii vaiivaii haeyase  suran sem
2SG  1PL      join-FUT later Q
"Will you join us later?"
```

## clauses

### dependent clause

`o` is added as a prefix before certain pronouns and adverbs to turn them into relative pronouns and adverbs to be used in dependent clauses.

|         | plain form | relative form |
| ------- | ---------- | ------------- |
| “who”   | `tem`      | `otem`        |
| “what”  | `tae`      | `otae`        |
| “where” | `tiil`     | `otiil`       |
| “when”  | `ta`       | `ota`         |
| “why”   | `tol`      | `otol`        |
| “how”   | `tam`      | `otam`        |
| “that”  | `taem`     | `otaem`       |
| “which” | `tes`      | `otes`        |

```jsx
"ota deii meris fa vaeso, deii eheso"
o-ta      deii meris fa vae-so,    deii ehe-so.
REL-when  3SG  moon  at look-PST,  3SG  smile-PST.
"When she looked at the moon, she smiled."
```

```jsx
**"iise otem nihoso vaii asu aeso vaeya"
iise   o-tem    niho-so    vaii asu ae-so  vaeya.
person REL-who  speak-PST  1SG  to  be-PST kind.
"The person who spoke to me was kind."
```

# words. vocab? idk what to call this section

## **nouns**

### pronouns

all pronouns are gender neutral. plural pronouns are made by reduplication.

|  | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first person | `vaii` ”I” | `vaiivaii` ”we/us” |
| second person | `koii` ”you“ | `koiikoii` ”you all” |
| third person | `deii` ”he/she/they/it” | `deiideii` ”them all” |

### **case system**

this language only has one true case, that being the genitive case. the suffix **`fel`** is added to the end of the noun possessing the object.

```jsx
"selafel nuye"
sela-fel    nuye
flower-GEN  petal
"The flower's petals"
```

```jsx
"niisafel saeka"
niisa-fel saeka
fire-GEN  color
"The color of the fire"
```

a pseudo-case that varae also utilizes is in regards to the [Inna](Inna%2099642857c4464973a4612f6533cb754d.md) - the god-like species that created the universe. when using pronouns in regards to them, the prefix `iina` is added. it acts as a sort of honorific, but is only utilized for the inna. generally, a person using this on themselves or another person would be thought of extremely negatively. 

|  | singular | plural |
| --- | --- | --- |
| first person | `iinavaii` ”I” | `iinavaiivaii` ”we” |
| second person | `iinakoii` ”you“ | `iinakoiikoii` ”you all” |
| third person | `iinadeii` ”he/she/they/it” | `iinadeiideii` ”them all” |

### plurality

varae generally does not express plurality. if the noun is countable, and the speaker wishes to specify how many of something there are, the speaker will generally just use numbers. in some cases, the noun can also be doubled to show there are many of something, but this is not always done.

## **adjectives**

adjectives are always placed before the noun they are describing. for example, `kumeiya leiv`, “*good dream*”. a noun can also be used as an adjective by adding the affix `ka` to the end of the noun, for example, `leiv`, “*dream”,* becomes `leivka`, “*dreamy”*.

### a note on adjectives in compound words (names only)

adjectives will always end in /**a**/, and when compound words are created (i.e. for names such as `yudora` meaning “little star”), the /**a**/ at the end is dropped. in the event of a /**ya**/ ending, such as in `uya` - “*young”*, the /**y**/ is dropped as well, resulting in, for example, `kumeileiv`, a compound noun/name with the same meaning as `kumeiya leiv`, meaning “*good dream”*. `dosa` (*red*) + `sela` (*flower*) becomes `dosela`, as stated in the phonotactics, double consonants are not allowed in the same word. the double /**s**/ is reduced to a single /**s**/. however, please note that these compound words are mainly only used for names, and in normal speech and prose “*red flower*” would still be `dosa sela`.

## **verbs**

verbs in dictionary/plain form end in `sii`. these verbs are in present tense, for example `vaesii` - ”to see/look”. verbs are not conjugated depending on gender or plurality, only tense and aspect.

there are three tenses - present, past, and future. to conjugate tense, the `sii` ending is replaced with a new ending depending on the tense - `so` for past, and `se` for future.

there are three aspects as well - plain, perfect, and continuous. for aspect, a suffix is added to the end of the verb- `me` for perfect, `ra` for continuous. 

to make a verb negative, the prefix `mo` is added to the beginning. 

nouns can also be turned into verbs by adding this `sii` suffix, for example `leiv`, meaning “*dream*” turns into `leivsii` “*to dream*”. this also works inversely, removing the `sii` suffix will turn a verb into a noun.

### regular verbs

| ***tense & aspect*** | plain affirmative | plain negative | perfect affirmative | perfect negative | continuous affirmative | continuous negative |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| present | `leivsii` “dreams” | `moleivsii` “doesn’t dream” | `leivsiime` ”has dreamt” | `moleivsiime` “hasn’t dreamt” | `leivsiira` “is dreaming” | `moleivsiira` “isn’t dreaming” |
| past | `leivso` “dreamt” | `moleiso` “didn’t dream” | `leivsome` “had dreamt” | `moleivsome` “hadn’t dreamt” | `leivsora` “was dreaming” | `moleivsora` “wasn’t dreaming” |
| future | `leivse` “will dream” | `moleivse` “won’t dream” | `leivseme` “will have dreamt” | `moleivseme` “won’t have dreamt” | `leivsera` “will be dreaming” | `moleivsera` “won’t be dreaming” |

### copula

the copula `ae` is the only irregular verb in varae, in the sense that it does not end in `sii`. present plain form is simply `ae` , and all affixes remain the same. 

```jsx
**"maerut ~ vaii somela aeme"
maerut ~  vaii somela ae-me.**
recently, 1SG  happy  be-PRS-PRF.
"Recently, I have been happy."
```

```jsx
**"honthe vaii ralaniin asu moaese garusera"
honthe  vaii ralaniin asu mo-ae-se   garu-se-ra.**
tonight 1SG  festival to  NEG-be-FUT go-FUT-CONT.
****"I will not be going to the festival tonight."
```

### moods

varae has three moods: the indicative, imperative, and the abilitative. they can be used by adding a mood-specific prefix before a verb. this prefix precedes any other prefix on the verb, such as the negation prefix `mo`.

|  | affirmative | negative |
| --- | --- | --- |
| indicative | `leivsii` “dream” | `moleivsii` “doesn’t dream” |
| imperative | `koleivsii` “dream!” | `komoleivsii` “don’t dream!” |
| abilitative | `soleivsii` “can dream” | `somoleivsii` “can’t dream” |

```jsx
**"vaii somoleivsii gobu sem"
vaii so-mo-leivsii   gobu sem**
1SG  ABL-NEG-dream   even Q
"Can't I even dream?"
```

## adverbs

adverbs do not always follow a strict pattern. they are always placed after the verb they modify. adjectives can be turned into adverbs by changing the last syllable, containing the /a/ ending, to `kel`. for example, `hata` , an adjective meaning “eager”, turns into `hakel`, an adverb meaning “eagerly”.

## **numbers and counting**

| `kii` *( 0 )* | `thae` *( 1 )* | `tei` *****( 2 )* | `iia` *****( 3 )* | `adi` *****( 4 )* | `uru` *****( 5 )* | `uiio` *****( 6 )* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `sus` *( 7 )* | `bii` *( 8 )* | `kuo` *****( 9 )* | `ran` *****( 10 )* | `siin` *****( 100 )* | `miin` *****( 1k )* | `wiin` *****( 1mil )* |

numbers after ten below 20 are `ran`+(digit), for example `ranuru`. tens from 20 to 90 are (digit)+`ran`, as in `teiran` to `kuoran`. hundreds from 200 to 900 are (digit)+`siin`. thousands from 2000 to 9000 are (digit)+`miin`.

`siin`, `miin`, and `wiin` can be `thaesiin`, `thaemiin`, and `thaewiin`, but it is not common.

when written out, each digit place is considered a separate word.

```jsx
**"uiiroran iia"
uiio-ran iia**
six-ten  three
"63" / "sixty three"
```

```jsx
**"iiasiin iiaran kuo"
iia-siin       iia-ran    kuo**
three-hundred  three-ten  nine
"339" / "three hundred thirty nine"
```

```jsx
**"biimiin siin adiran uru"
bii-miin        siin    adi-ran   uru**
eight-thousand  hundred four-ten  five
"8145" / "eight thousand one hundred forty five"
```

### a note on written varae

varae, in the world of [lunatine](lunatine%20d3a18d7ba2e24989bc945ee7018c653c.md), is written in a native script. however, for most *meta* purposes, it is romanized. the following rules are meant to adapt the written script into a more easily accessible format for learners and people interested in the world and its language.

the main speakers of varae are the [Selhae](Selhae%20822e316012e74ddba8bb5c6faf31fe66.md), who have always had a very heavy focus on oral storytelling and music, as a culture. this means that the most common way something is passed along is verbally, and writing is not as common. some of these rules may seem unintuitive for long, detailed writing, but writing was generally reserved for preserving songs and stories, and communication between people (i.e. letters) - which all tended to be more poetic in nature.

</aside>

## prose forms

when written, periods are not used to mark the end of a sentence. instead, each new sentence is written on a new line. 

instead of commas, written varae uses a tilde `~` to divide sentences into phrases/clauses. these are not always used depending on context, but are often added for clarity and when sentences become too long.

lines can be broken off after a `~` or a `{` to prevent it from running off the page or simply becoming unreadably long. this is not necessary on all sentences, even if it has multiple clauses. when this is done, the continuation on the next line is indented so as not to be confused with a new sentence. 

in informal writing, or where it is not possible to break lines or indent, lines may be broken at any point and may not be indented. however, if this is done, any following lines must be separated with enough visual space to be able to tell where one line ends and another begins.

```jsx
deii ~ otu vala dorafel anwaefa osu renaksii ~
	dorafel korliia dae weise nerasii veha
telasiira ~ deii yovela pahorii dala beirusii ~ 
	na iinyaniilfel hiimana fa vahes meikasii
ota deii lukasii nako karawesii ~ 
	na vala dae tayaso ne geralo sakakesii muhaelii
yiim deiifel kin ne teraniil asu keso
```

```jsx
deii otu vala dorafel
anwaefa osu renaksii
dorafel korliia dae
weise nerasii veha

telasiira ~ deii yovela
pahorii dala beirusii
na iinyaniilfel hiimana
fa vahes meikasii
```

## capitalization

romanized varae is written entirely in lower case, with no upper case letters.

## quotes

quotes/quotations, in written varae, use curly brackets `{ }` as quotation markers. 

```jsx
**"ota vaii beiso ~ deii vaii haraeso {koii aese mae vaiimosa}"
o-ta     vaii beiso ~    deii vaii harae-so koii koaese     mae  vaiimosa.**
REL-when 1SG  leave-PAS, 3SG  1SG  tell-PAS you  IMP-be-FUT safe please
