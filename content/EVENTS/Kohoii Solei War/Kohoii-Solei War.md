1. an ongoing war between the settlement of [Kohoii](Kohoii%205ec34e8227ec4373998d026fd09ee730.md) and the kingdom of [Solei](Solei%20a43736a3946f491ab5b40ad8e7fab381.md), which began when Solei attempted to annex the neighboring settlement of Kohoii. 
2. Solei, being a much larger force than Kohoii, began by occupying the settlement. Kohoii’s mages and warriors tried to fight them off for a while, but a devastating battle claimed many casualties (including [Naediia](Naediia%20dc678366936e41f384da240a61708663.md), the elder’s daughter and head mage) and left the people of Kohoii with little choice but to accept the occupation, for now.
    1. Solei used [Kulith](Kulith%206b51a534f7f148af8253f5706f402a1b.md)’s powerful abilities as a weapon in this battle.
