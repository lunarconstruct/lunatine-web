## About
A young adult [[SPECIES/Selhae/index\|Selhae]] born in the village of [[LOCATIONS/Solei/index\|Solei]]. Born with an abnormally high concentration of [Dust](Dust%20e5dd6dcde4974c6ca3920c91cad7c2cb.md), their magic is powerful, yet unpredictable and hard to control. The heightened concentration of dust in Kulith’s [Soul](Soul%20f5650c5d3be2487194e629cc898ca601.md) also influenced their appearance, giving them a blue tint to their pale skin, and ice blue hair.

Kulith’s magic centers around the ability to manipulate sound waves. When controlled and intentional, these powers can be used in benevolent ways such as making music and creating sound barriers for protection. However, due to its powerful and unpredictable nature, it can often be harmful - manipulating enough energy to create powerful blasts and even cause earthquakes. Using their powers in this way drains a lot of energy out of Kulith.

### **Personal history**

From a young age, it was clear that Kulith was different from her peers. Her magic was hard to control, especially as a child, and thus became an issue very early on. She would get overstimulated or frustrated easily, making it harder and harder for her to keep her magic controlled. 

As a child, authorities in Solei pressured Kulith into using their magic in attacks on [Kohoii](Kohoii%205ec34e8227ec4373998d026fd09ee730.md) during the [Kohoii/Solei War](Kohoii%20Solei%20War%203650a8f12f42430cbb47a319975bca7a.md) . This unfortunately resulted in the death of [Naediia](Naediia%20dc678366936e41f384da240a61708663.md), [Esela](Esela%207a0dac9b9d0f422489c6e9609eef84a6.md)’s mother. Kulith was never told about the casualties of these attacks, and both her and Esela don’t know that it was Kulith who killed Naediia. [Reika](Reika%20c3f81d2257d84c019e43faa2f13a035c.md), being the elder of Kohoii, was aware of this, which heavily contributed to her vehement disapproval of Kulith and Esela together.

Kulith worked to escape Solei, no longer wanting to be used as a weapon in such a malicious war. Finally, in 1220 they were able to escape, and came across Esela in the [Maeniil](Maeniil%202639c0bb7d004eca8bde4f17ca7a6cc2.md). The two fell for each other instantly, and Esela hid Kulith in the Maeniil away from her grandmother’s judgmental eyes.
