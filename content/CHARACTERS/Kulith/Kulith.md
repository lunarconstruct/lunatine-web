A young adult Selhae born in the village of Solei. Born with an abnormally high concentration of Dust, their magic is powerful, yet unpredictable and hard to control. The heightened concentration of dust in Kulith’s Soul also influenced their appearance, giving them a blue tint to their pale skin, and ice blue hair. Kulith was captured and used by the Solei government as a weapon, and assisted Esela in the Crescentmoon migration, but was trapped on Asilles due to Esela’s power waning.
