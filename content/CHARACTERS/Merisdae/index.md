## About

---

Merisdae is a construct created by [Esela](Esela%207a0dac9b9d0f422489c6e9609eef84a6.md) in order to preside over the people who had migrated to [Kuraesmeris](Kuraesmeris%2039c7d3756b5b49399f2860c0862ed433.md) during the [Kuraesmeris Migration](Kuraesmeris%20Migration%20132911817b6a4e839ac229c3f65e7bc9.md) . 

### Moon Forms

![merisforms.png](CHARACTERS/Merisdae/merisforms.png)

Merisdae also has the ability to split herself into 5 forms. Each of these forms are named after the [Asilles](Asilles%2079f784ab6fd945de9a6813c70677d52e.md) moons. In the image, from top to bottom, left to right, they are [HiitoMerisdae](HiitoMerisdae%2015ac5cb610f5808c8a2ed7f52d75dd55.md)  ([bluemoon](https://www.notion.so/bluemoon-18725f4a19934efa8c925ef89f10a19b?pvs=21)), [KuraesMerisdae](KuraesMerisdae%2015ac5cb610f580fe93dfd8851dd0aeb5.md) ([crescentmoon](https://www.notion.so/crescentmoon-1d19a3f9425d4fa09d586dc3ea91c1cc?pvs=21)), [BuroMerisdae](BuroMerisdae%2015ac5cb610f580c68399dc731bfb73a3.md) ([bloodmoon](https://www.notion.so/bloodmoon-2b55e91d432c4a9f94dfe3119b5c0eae?pvs=21)), [KaeMerisdae](KaeMerisdae%2015ac5cb610f580f08af0f538639b8e4e.md) ([newmoon](https://www.notion.so/newmoon-b27c029af2a143d0ade5cd07b1d93dac?pvs=21)), and [FolMerisdae](FolMerisdae%2015ac5cb610f58017bff4e17bc3e19042.md) ([fullmoon](https://www.notion.so/fullmoon-88d2824eb7fd40cc84d74a09f5666c5e?pvs=21)). Each of these forms were created to watch over their respective moons. 

### Supermoon

![maikory merisdae.png](maikory_merisdae%201.png)

Merisdae's "truest" form. Merisdae was originally a construct of [Anwi](Anwi%20af7e2c72103f45cdbee264ff6beb0e57.md) and [Wefa](Wefa%200d386a3f0d714b369130ebed9c6f58cd.md), the [Inna](Inna%2099642857c4464973a4612f6533cb754d.md), that created Asilles, but something happened to where she was de-constructed and left in her object form, the moonband. When [Esela](Esela%207a0dac9b9d0f422489c6e9609eef84a6.md) found the moonband and constructed Merisdae again, she appeared different due to not having the same soul.

## Physical Description

---

### **Body Features**

Merisdae has a slender build, with a height of 5'4'' or 164cm. They have long, straight, flowy deep purple hair with blunt bangs and long sidelocks. 

### **Facial Features**

They have pinkish-magenta eyes, with the Lunatine symbol in their pupils.

### **Special abilities**

[**Catalyst’s Soul**](Soul%20f5650c5d3be2487194e629cc898ca601.md) 

One of their most impressive abilities is the power to split themselves into five distinct forms, each of which represents one of the Asilles moons. This ability allows Merisdae to be in multiple places at once and keep a watchful eye over all of the moons simultaneously.

When Merisdae splits into her five forms, each form retains its specific memories while also retaining memories from when they were merged. However, they do not have memories of the other forms while separated. Once they merge back into one form, Merisdae has all of the memories of the five forms combined.

Furthermore, Merisdae is gifted with the ability to summon five small “moons” from the Moonband. These moons can be used in a variety of ways, from enhancing their physical strength to providing a source of light in a dark environment. 

In addition to these powers, Merisdae also possesses the ability to manipulate gravity. 

### **Apparel & Accessories**

Merisdae wears a long, purple dress with a slit up the left side. The bottom of the dress is lined with the pattern shown on the right. The dress comes up to a sweetheart neckline, with a gold border across the top. In the center of the bust, connected to this border, is a small, pink diamond shape with a gold border around this as well. On her shoulders are sheer, light blue chiffon off-the-shoulder sleeves. The same material is used around her waist as well, where a long sash/belt is tied around her waist - one knot tied on either side of her hips. Each knot comes with a ribbon coming off of the belt, floating down to almost the same length as her dress. These ribbon tails become thinner at the end, almost becoming transparent. On her right leg, a blue ribbon is tied up to just below her knee, similar to a ballet shoe's ribbon. Due to her ability to float, she does not wear shoes.

### **Specialized Equipment**

On her head, Merisdae can be seen wearing the [Moonband](Moonband%2091567d1e97bb4b53be7fc62690dab52f.md) , a golden headband with five moon stones embedded into it. This item is what Merisdae was constructed from. Merisdae is able to summon forth 5 small moons from the moonband. When she does his, the moonband is not seen atop her head.

## Mental Characteristics

### **Personal history**

Merisdae was created by the [Inna](Inna%2099642857c4464973a4612f6533cb754d.md), [Anwi](Anwi%20af7e2c72103f45cdbee264ff6beb0e57.md) and [Wefa](Wefa%200d386a3f0d714b369130ebed9c6f58cd.md) to be a guardian of [Asilles](Asilles%2079f784ab6fd945de9a6813c70677d52e.md) and to choose a [Selhae](Selhae%20822e316012e74ddba8bb5c6faf31fe66.md) to guide the people up to the moons in the [Kuraesmeris Migration](Kuraesmeris%20Migration%20132911817b6a4e839ac229c3f65e7bc9.md). She chose [Esela](Esela%207a0dac9b9d0f422489c6e9609eef84a6.md) to be this guide, linking the two’s souls together.

She saved [Kaeyomii](Kaeyomii%205142f8eb7e52434bb492e122dceb3f62.md)’s soul from the [Debris Impact](Debris%20Impact%20ed20ff388be6470196280bfd47d06e5d.md) by taking Kaeyomii’s soul into her own, which influenced the appearance of her [KaeMerisdae](KaeMerisdae%2015ac5cb610f580f08af0f538639b8e4e.md) form. However, saving Kaeyomii led to the deconstruction of Merisdae back down to the [Moonband](Moonband%2091567d1e97bb4b53be7fc62690dab52f.md).

Due to the link between her and Esela, Esela was able to find the moonband and reconstruct Merisdae. She does not have any recollection of her previous incarnation, but she does remember the goal given to her by the Inna - save the people of Asilles.
