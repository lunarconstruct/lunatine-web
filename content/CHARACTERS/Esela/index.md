### Special abilities
Esela’s [**Seeker’s Soul**](Soul%20f5650c5d3be2487194e629cc898ca601.md)  allows her to teleport.
Esela has to be able to visualize clearly the destination in order to be able to teleport. She has to have been there before, not just seen in pictures or described to her. Breaking concentration on the location can result in a unsteady arrival, or sometimes being teleported to the wrong place entirely.
Initially, she can only teleport herself short distances. However, with the amplification of [Merisdae](Merisdae%2096ee77d2a5d24d1aa718c98ca012d365.md), she is capable of transporting groups of people over long distances. The further the distance, the more dust is required, meaning it takes a lot of Esela’s energy.
