## About
A species created by [Anwi](Anwi%20af7e2c72103f45cdbee264ff6beb0e57.md) to live upon the planet [Asilles](Asilles%2079f784ab6fd945de9a6813c70677d52e.md).

## Generic
### Anatomy & Morphology
The Selhae are a species resembling our Earth's own humans, alike in almost every manner. Physically, Selhae have a wider range of natural hair and eye colors, but skin color and other features are very much the same.

### Growth Rate & Stages
Selhae are a very long-lived species. They can live upwards of 600-700 years, sometimes even longer if healthy. They age similarly to humans up until around age 20, at which rate their aging slows down. At this rate, roughly every 20-30 years is equivalent to 1 year of a human aging.

The point at which a Selhae’s aging slows is when they are considered an “adult”, and there is usually a coming-of-age celebration.

### Genetics & Reproduction
Selhae are able to reproduce until very late in life, due to their aging slowing down after age 20. Generally speaking, they can reproduce until they are around 400 years old.

### Myths and Legends
As the [[SPECIES/Inna/index|Inna]] took a very real part in the creation of [[LOCATIONS/Asilles/index\|Asilles]], the creation mythos tends to be pretty close to reality. 

Descendants of the original Selhae created by Anwi passed down [[CONCEPTS/The Story of the Inna/index\|The Story of the Inna]]. These original Selhae created the clans as they’re known today, and the head/elder of the clans are usually direct descendants of these original Selhae clan heads.

The story of the Inna is taught by the heads of the clans to the children of the clan/settlement, to pass the story on.

The Selhae believe that they were gifted the power of [[CONCEPTS/Construction/index\|Construction]] to aid in their mission of making the world a worthy place for the Inna to return to. They believe that their duty is to shape the world according to the Inna's will and prepare it for their eventual return. The Selhae see themselves as caretakers of the world, and they take their role very seriously.

### Art
Selhae place great value on music and oral storytelling in their culture. These traditions are deeply ingrained in their society and serve to connect the people to their history and to each other.

One way in which these stories and tales are preserved is through the use of ballads and music. These ballads and songs are often passed down through the generations, ensuring that the traditions and stories of the Selhae are not lost over time.

In addition to ballads and music, the Selhae also use storytelling as a means of teaching and passing on knowledge. Through these oral stories, the Selhae are able to share important lessons and values with younger generations, ensuring that their culture and way of life are preserved for years to come.
