## About
Constructs are magical beings created by the [[SPECIES/Selhae/index\|Selhae]] and the [[SPECIES/Inna/index\|Inna]]. They come in many forms and can be made for various reasons, such as companionship or assistance.
They are created by imbuing an inanimate object with a piece of the creator's soul and a great deal of magic. The soulpiece and magic are then pulled out of the object, resulting in a living being that can take on almost any form the creator wishes, including humanoid, animal, and mythical creature forms.

These Constructs are incredibly versatile and can fulfill various roles, depending on the reason they were created. Traditionally, Constructs were created as assistants or companions to help with work or to travel with their creators. However, many Selhae now create Constructs solely for companionship, sometimes taking on the role of a child or a pet. Constructs can also be designed to serve specific functions, such as guarding or providing medical assistance.

One of the advantages of Constructs is their ability to learn and adapt. They possess a level of intelligence that allows them to understand and perform complex tasks. With proper training, they can even exceed the capabilities of their creators. Additionally, Constructs do not experience fatigue or illness, making them ideal for work that requires long hours or exposure to harmful environments.

## Basic Information
### Anatomy & Morphology
Constructs can take on any form the creator desires. This is however limited by the amount of magic put into making the construct. For example, only putting the bare minimum amount of magic into making a construct will only allow you to create a construct that is small, like the size of a rodent or small mammal.

### Perception & Sensory / Extrasensory Capabilities
Constructs are able to perceive and sense their surroundings based on the form they take. For example, if a construct takes on the form of a bird, it will have heightened vision and be able to fly. Constructs can also have extrasensory capabilities such as telepathy or the ability to sense magic, depending on the amount of magic imbued into them by their Selhae creator.

### Genetics & Reproduction
Constructs do not reproduce or have genetics in the traditional sense. Instead, their appearance and mannerisms are influenced by the soulpiece used to create them. The larger the soulpiece, the more the Selhae's soul influences the construct's traits. As a result, some constructs may resemble either the Selhae or those who were close to them, as a soul is composed of the people close to you.

### Growth Rate & Stages
Constructs do not age at all. Since they are connected to their creator's soul, once the creator dies, the construct will either die with the creator, or the creator can imbue the rest of their soul into the construct and the construct will live on, aging like a Selhae until it dies of natural causes.

### Ecology & Habitat
Constructs do not have specific ecological or habitat needs since they do not require sustenance or a living environment. They exist solely to serve their Selhae creator, and their activities are generally limited to the tasks assigned to them. Constructs can travel with their Selhae creators, but they do not require a specific environment to survive.

### Average Physique

### Uses, Byproducts and Exploitation
Constructs are created to assist their Selhae creators in various tasks, such as work or travel. They are not exploited or used for any other purpose beyond their intended function.
