## About

<aside>
<img src="https://www.notion.so/icons/stars_purple.svg" alt="https://www.notion.so/icons/stars_purple.svg" width="40px" /> Ancient cosmic beings who plant the seeds of new worlds in their Garden, and from those worlds spring newborn Inna. Rarely do they visit these worlds in person, but on such occasions they will hide their true form and blend in among the locals, indistinguishable save for their planetary eyes.

</aside>

The oldest Inna has been around since the beginning of the universe, made purely of [Dust](Dust%20e5dd6dcde4974c6ca3920c91cad7c2cb.md). They awoke to an empty void, [The Expanse](The%20Expanse%20aae43c29a9ac4e94b8043b45e9f63a0b.md) - and used their unique gift of [Creation](Creation%20514a94ac18e24c60b6ca42ca5f194015.md) to give meaning to the universe. They created the [World Seed](World%20Seed%2079ce63c075c84da084bc3ad1f11cab5e.md)s, ultra-compressed pockets of dust used to grow worlds, to plant in the [World Garden](World%20Garden%205a6cfe0468e64efe8e9b097f621b0ca2.md). These World seeds become planets, and at the end of their lifecycle, the seed finally flowers - and a new Inna is born from the dying world.

Since the first Inna, worlds have come and gone - planets once flourishing with life transformed into new Inna, who keep the cycle going. Traditionally, Inna are given permission by their caretakers - the Inna who planted their seed - to cultivate their own world seed, though this is not always the case. Some Inna choose not to grow worlds, and some go against their caretakers will and do so independently.

Inna rarely visit their worlds personally, and will sometimes create [Construct](Construct%2038fe566bb96341be8aa944ee36e73b6d.md)s using [Construction](Construction%20aefd8cb2a0184071a880b20e5ad2d552.md) to watch over their seeds for them.

### Anatomy & Morphology

The Inna are large, abstract beings - created fully of [Soul](Soul%20f5650c5d3be2487194e629cc898ca601.md) dust, they normally do not contain any [Essence](Essence%20175c5cb610f580449e11d1751073f30c.md) to provide them with a physical form that would be recognizable as a living creature. They are often depicted as clouds of dust, or galaxies full of stars, as they are made up of the universe.

They do have the ability to take on any form they wish. Sometimes, Inna will appear in the shape of the creatures on their world, and observe the planet from within. 

### Perception & Sensory / Extrasensory Capabilities

Inna have a unique gift of [Creation](Creation%20514a94ac18e24c60b6ca42ca5f194015.md), which they use to grow worlds from [World Seed](World%20Seed%2079ce63c075c84da084bc3ad1f11cab5e.md) . Additionally, they have the power of [Construction](Construction%20aefd8cb2a0184071a880b20e5ad2d552.md). Some Inna use this ability to create constructs to assist in tending to their seed.

### Genetics & Reproduction

Inna are born from worlds at their end, which flower into new Inna. Traditionally, Inna are given permission by their caretakers - the Inna who planted their seed - to cultivate their own world seed, though this is not always the case. Some Inna choose not to grow worlds, and some go against their caretakers will and do so independently.

Inna will often grow worlds together with others they care about, such as a romantic partnership, a strong friendship, a sibling or family member. These units can be as small or as large as the Inna wishes - some Inna take the burden of creation on their shoulders alone, and some will grow their world seed together with the support of many others. Sometimes, multiple of these units will all grow seeds together in the same vicinity, and share resources like a sun.

The lifespan of the world/world seed depends on the Inna cultivating it. Some Inna do not care much for the world - only using it as a means to grow a new Inna. Some, however, care deeply about the world they create and see it as an important phase of the Inna cycle. These latter Inna may decide to create life on their worlds for this reason.

Worlds grown by the former may appear bleak, desolate, and devoid of life. To these Inna, the world is a means to an end - what happens in between when the seed is planted and when the seed blooms doesn’t matter to them. The seed must still be given the bare amount of attention, as world seeds do have the possibility of dying before they can bloom.

Contrastingly, worlds grown by attentive and caring Inna will be lush, prospering worlds with animal and plant life - and occasionally sentient life as well if the caretakers wish. Some Inna believe that the better you care for the world seed, the more well-off the Inna will be when it is born.

### Growth Rate & Stages

1. world seed
    1. the core of a world. super compact and powerful dust
2. growing planet
3. waning planet
4. bloomed inna
5. waning inna
    1. their dust will wane over time, causing the inna to weaken
    2. powerful inna are able to absorb more dust when theirs begin to wane so they can keep themselves alive for longer
6. death
    1. if all of an inna’s dust wanes, the inna would fade out of existence.

### Naming Traditions

Inna are named by their caretakers upon their birth. Each name is unique and is meant to reflect the Inna's personality and role in the universe. 

In some cases, Inna may choose to change their names as they grow and evolve. This is typically done to reflect a change in the Inna's role or personality, or to signify a significant event in their life. However, these name changes are rare and are only done under special circumstances.
