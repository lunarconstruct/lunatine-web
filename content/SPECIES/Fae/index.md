### Myths and Legends
Descendants of the original [[SPECIES/Fae/index\|Fae]] created by [[CHARACTERS/Wefa/index\|Wefa]] passed down [[CONCEPTS/The Story of the Inna/index\|The Story of the Inna]]. 

The original fae were not so social as to create clans like their [[SPECIES/Selhae/index\|Selhae]] counterparts, so the [[SPECIES/Inna/index|Inna]]’s story is simply passed from parent to child.

The Fae believe that they were given [[CONCEPTS/Elemental Magic/index\|Elemental Magic]] as a way to connect with the world created by the Inna. They believe that their magical abilities allow them to communicate with the elements and understand the world on a deeper level.

The Fae see themselves as a bridge between the Inna and the world they created, and they take pride in their ability to interpret the will of the Inna and act accordingly.

### Art
The Fae tend to focus on more physical art, such as weaving, painting, sculpting, pottery, and woodworking. They have a deep appreciation for the natural world and often incorporate elements of nature into their art, such as using wood and stone from the environment to create sculptures or using natural dyes to color their textiles.
