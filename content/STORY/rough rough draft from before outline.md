# rough rough draft from before outline

[esela is in the maeniil, sitting on the ground and leaning up against a tree. she is embroidering. she is very focused on her work. she blinks a few times, her eyes adjusting to the low light, and finally seems to notice that the sun has gone down. ]

esela : *where did the time go!? i swear, it was just noon..*

[she scrambles up and tries to get her things together. she runs into her little hut thing to put her stuff away and grab what she needs to take home.]

[esela teleports herself back to her room in her grandmother’s cottage in kohoii. she stumbles out of the teleport, making enough noise to let reika know she was here]

reika : “sela, is that you??”

[esela can hear reikas footsteps getting closer, until she flings open the door to esela’s room, and breathes a sigh of relief.]

reika : “it *is* you! where have you been??”

[reika sounds angry, but she is mostly concerned and stressed. she runs up to esela and pulls her into a tight hug.]

esela : “i.. i’m sorry, *adela*, i lost track of the time..” 

reika : “this just keeps happening, esela..! you were supposed to be back hours ago. how are we going to get anything done in time if you’re going to go missing every time we need you?”

[esela feels super guilty. she looks like a kicked puppy :pweasey: :pleadingface: :uncursedcry:. reika sighs and calms down a bit, then tries to lighten the mood a little and starts to head towards the door.]

reika : “anyways, the work has already been done. i was, surprisingly, able to convince [reika’s construct] to step away from his paperwork for two seconds and help me out. it’s like pulling teeth with him, trying to get him to do anything else!”

[esela lets out a light giggle.]

esela : “that sounds like him, alright. does he ever take a break? does he even sleep?”

[reika chuckles.]

reika : “if he does, he sure doesn’t let me know.”

[teapot screams from the other room]

reika : “ah, that’s my tea. dinner will be ready soon, so freshen up, okay?” (lighthearted) “you look a mess!”

[esela realizes the scrambling before and tumbling into her room had caused her hair to go awry, not to mention the dirt on her dress from sitting in the maeniil.]

esela : “i will… i’ll be out in a few.”

[reika leaves the room and closes the door behind her. as soon as she is alone, esela falls back onto her bed. she stares up at her ceiling.]

 esela : *i keep messing these things up… why does she still think i can do this? no matter how much i mess up…….*
