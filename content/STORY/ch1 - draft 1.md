“Ah, *ow*!!”

A prick with a needle always hurt more than it ought to, but this time it was simply the shock of being pricked that caused Esela to finally pay attention. In her recoil, she dropped the needle, which she had been so carefully using to embroider tiny flowers along the edge of one of her previously-plain dresses. She may not be a skilled seamstress, but she could at least give her clothes a little flair with some handiwork - the same flair she gives to everything she can get her hands on.

With the drop of the needle, Esela’s attention was finally pulled away from her hard work, and down to the ground to find the needle. It hadn’t landed in her lap, and the tall grass and wildflowers beneath her obscured the ground and sealed this poor needle’s fate to become one with nature.

With a sigh in frustration, Esela closed her eyes and threw her head back to lean up against her tree. She didn’t have any more needles - all of her others had met similar fates along her tremulous embroidery-learning journey. As she opened her eyes, and got a glimpse of the sky through the canopy of leaves above her, Esela realized just how long she had been entranced in her Embroidery Fugue.

Last she had looked at the sky, it was just past noon. By now, the sky was beginning to grow dark, and the moons were starting to become visible.

“Oh, crap, it’s already sundown??” She muttered under her breath as she shot herself up onto her feet. Esela knew she was always alone in the *maeniil -* her safe place, so she felt more than comfortable speaking aloud to herself, narrating her seemingly never-ending inner monologue. “I just know *Adela* is going to be so upset with me this time. I can’t believe I forgot again…”

As much as she would have enjoyed spending the rest of the evening in her favorite spot in all of Asilles, embroidering and ignoring the world, she unfortunately had other responsibilities to take care of. Her grandmother, Village Elder Reika, had expected Esela to be back at home hours ago. She was supposed to help her with planning the harvest festival happening in her village of Kohoii that was just a few days away.

Esela quickly dusted off her layered pink, purple, and white dress and grabbed her things - her embroidery hoop and threads, as well as a small pouch - from her comfortable spot on the ground. Once everything was gathered, she took a deep breath, closed her eyes, and focused all of her energy on visualizing her room in her grandmother’s cottage. Esela could almost feel the tingles of the Dust within her resonating with her vivid memory of her childhood bedroom.

She had lived with her grandmother for as long as she could remember, which was made obvious by the sheer amount of *things* in her tiny cottage room. She had what most Selhae in her village would have in their room: a bed, a dresser, a bookcase - but Esela was also somewhat of a collector. Not only did she collect physical things like trinkets and books, her walls were lined with shelves full of them, but she also collected hobbies and crafts.

Her room was filled to the brim with flowers of all kinds - Gardenias being her favorite - from when she wanted to be a gardener or a florist. Her closet was full of half-finished dresses from her (failed) attempt at learning to sew, and lining the wall were baskets upon baskets of yarn from her foray into knitting and crochet. There was an easel by the window, set up with a blank canvas in the event she ever decided to try to paint again. And at her small desk, were piles of journals she either would use as diaries or attempt to write stories. Everything she did seemed to be temporary, only holding her attention for so long before she got tired of it, and moved onto the next.

One thing that had always kept Esela’s attention, though, was music. She had written many songs, some for performing, some just for herself. Her desk was scattered with all of the sheet music that she was working on.

And when she opened her eyes, there she was. Though, she didn’t appear in the center of the room or on her bed like she was expecting her teleportation powers to take her, but instead appeared on top of her already cluttered desk. Her trailing thoughts had distracted her enough to throw off her accuracy, and she stumbled into her room, toppling the stacks of books and journals and tripping herself to the ground with a crash.

From the other room, there was a quick, startled gasp, and then someone called out to her.

“Sela? Is that you in there??” The frail, concerned voice made it clear that her grandmother must have heard her stumble in.

Obviously used to Esela’s antics by now, her grandmother made her way straight to Esela’s room to check if her granddaughter had finally reappeared hours after she was supposed to be home. The door to her room was thrown open, and as soon as Reika saw Esela’s pink hair and dress in a pathetic pile on the ground surrounded by clutter, she breathed a sigh of relief.

“No use asking you where you’ve been, we both know where you were. We were all waiting for you earlier, you couldn’t even let us know?” Reika scolded, her wrinkled face contorted into an expression that made Esela unsure if Reika was angry, worried, or both. She would assume both.

Esela sat herself up on the floor, and looked up at Reika’s stern figure guiltily. “I-, I’m sorry, *Adela*, I lost track of the time again…” she stuttered, knowing full well this wasn’t the first time and more likely than not wouldn’t be the last.

“You can be sorry all you want, but being sorry won’t give me back all the time it took to convince Soren to help me instead. Wouldn’t lift their eyes from their books even for a moment, I don’t know how you get anything out of them.” Reika said with a smirk. That sounded about right, for Soren. Soren was another kid who grew up in Kohoii with Esela - only a few years younger than her. They had been friends since they were young, though their relationship had been more akin to cousins. “They’re always eager to help out when you’re around, Sela. You must have some sort of trick with them.”

“No tricks, all you have to do is be a little older than someone and they look up to you, I suppose. They just like to try to impress me, always been like that.”

Reika chuckled. “Don’t you think I’m quite old enough for that to work for me, hm?”

“A little older and a lot older is a big difference.” Esela retorted with a smirk as she picked herself up off of the ground.

Reika feigned offense at the jab with an exaggerated gasp and a clutch at her chest. Esela was always grateful Reika had at least a sense of humor, or else her scoldings would feel much worse. The two of them laughed for a moment before being interrupted by the whistle of a kettle coming from the kitchen.

“Oh, all your ruckus made me forget about my tea!” she turned towards the door, talking to Esela over her shoulder. “I need to get that - get yourself freshened up and come out for dinner when you’re done.”

“Okay, *Adela*, I will.”

“And you look a mess, by the way. You’re going to need to wash that dress tonight, it's covered it dirt!” Now she was just stalling.

“*Okay*, Adela.” Esela said exasperatedly.

Reika gave her a smile, and closed the door to her room. When she heard her footsteps retreating to the kitchen, Esela tossed herself onto her bed.

She may have been joking around with her, but Esela knew that Reika was still upset with her. Being the elder of the village, Reika had many responsibilities that would be passed down to Esela when… that time came. She knew it was a great honor, being able to take over for her grandmother to lead the village she had grown up in and loved. But the responsibility of it all was something that Esela was having a hard time accepting she could handle and was worthy of.

Under normal circumstances, Esela’s mother, Naediia, would have been next in line to be elder, after Reika. But, when Naediia passed, that responsibility was given to Esela, instead - who was only a young child at the time. At first she was eager to take after her grandmother, but as she got older, the weight of the responsibility began to weigh on her.

Because, as much as she wished the responsibility of village elder just required her to plan festivals, there were much more pressing matters at hand, as well - the most pressing of them being Solei’s attempts to annex Kohoii.

Kohoii had always been an independent settlement, founded by Reika’s grandparents. The neighboring kingdom, Solei, had always been quite imperialistic - and has on many occasions tried to take Kohoii into their kingdom. Kohoii was not meant to be owned by another - and so they resisted, over and over again. There were many attacks on Kohoii - and it was in one of these battles that Esela’s mother had died. Solei had gained a powerful asset - a child, whose powers went far beyond the abilities of any normal Selhae.

Reika has held much resentment towards Solei since then, though the attacks have halted in recent years. Solei has had bigger issues to deal with than annexing a small village, much to the relief of the people of Kohoii. But the threat of another attack has always loomed over them.

Esela sighed and sat herself up at the edge of the bed - she should probably get ready for dinner like her grandmother had asked. She had already, albeit unintentionally, ignored her requests once today - it certainly would do no good to ignore her again.
