# **inna arc**

in the beginning, there was nothing, and then there was **The Expanse**. the expanse was vast, and empty, save for **Dust** . from the dust came **Hafei**, the first of the **Inna**. the inna are cosmic beings, made entirely of dust. not omnipotent or omniscient, but regarded like gods due to the immense amount of dust that they consist of making them extremely powerful.

to give meaning to the then-empty void, hafei created the **World Garden**. **World Seed**s are planted in the garden, and from the seeds grow new worlds. at the natural end of the world, a newborn inna blossoms from the seed.

together with the first few inna born in the garden, hafei forms the **Seedkeeper Council** to govern over the inna. the council puts into place a set of **tenets** that all inna must follow.



1. **Neglect not the garden you have sown.**
    - *Care for your creations.*
    1. World seeds must not be neglected or treated badly. It can result in a weak, hurt Inna, which is cruel to the Inna and to the Expanse.
2. **Creation leads to Endings, and Endings lead to Beginnings.**
    - *The cycle of created life must be respected.*
    1. All dust taken from the expanse must return to the expanse. Dust contributed to a world seed must return to the Inna that blooms from it.
3. **Honor the connections between Inna.**
    - *All threads are connected.*
    1. Conflict between Inna is meaningless. All Inna work toward the same goal, and all Inna are connected through Dust.

inna who don’t follow these tenets get punished, usually by having some or all of their dust confiscated by the **Garden Wardens** . losing dust means losing power, and life. lose all of your dust, and you cease to exist.

unbeknownst to most inna, this dust that is being confiscated from rule-breakers is actually being given to hafei to extend his life. powerful inna that are close to hafei tend to hold the same beliefs as him, but many inna do not agree with his practices. some inna do not believe all life on a planet should end with the bloom of an inna, and believe the inna and the people of its seed can and should exist at the same time.

hafei has been around long enough and has absorbed enough dust throughout that time that he is *much* stronger than any inna that has tried to dissent, but he cannot be everywhere at once. so, he enlists many inna to become the  **the fieldtenders** - spread out across the expanse to uphold each of the tenets for hafei.

**Anwi** and **Wefa** are part of the **World Curators**, meaning they travel the expanse checking on worlds being grown to ensure they’re growing well and not being neglected.
**Emeut** is part of the **[name pending]**, who travel the expanse to find any stray life that may have left a planet before the bloom of an inna, and ensure that inna are not intentionally disrupting the balance.

emeut is a relatively powerful inna, that has been around for a while (not as long as hafei but longer than many inna). he has been harboring very extremist ideals, that inna should not be so concerned with the care of their seeds, and should be making as many inna as possible -regardless of how neglected they are - to fill the expanse. while under the guise of working for the council, he has been using his dust to essentially “fund” other inna’s worlds for his own means. this has gained him many followers.

Anwi and Wefa check up on Emeut as part of their job and find that he has been neglecting many world seeds and creating essentially an army of inna to try to overthrow hafei. emeut had convinced many other inna to help him create many world seeds that they ultimately would not put any care into, just so they would bloom as soon as possible and become inna to work and fight for emeut when the time came for his coup.

when this is found out, anwi and wefa report it to the council and emeut is punished severely by the garden wardens, and has most of his dust taken away. other world curators are sent out to investigate and ensure whoever was working with emeut gets punished as well. this not only fuels emeut’s anger towards the council and hafei, but also towards anwi and wefa.

some time later, Anwi and Wefa plant their own world seed together. this seed sprouts into the planet **Asilles**. 4 moons sprouted around the planet as well - **Kuraesmeris** / crescentmoon, **Hiitomeris** / bluemoon, **Buromeris** / bloodmoon, and **Folmeris** / fullmoon.

as the planet grows, the pair decide to gift it sentient life as well. they each use their power of **Creation** to create beings to live on the planet, each with **Soul**s that work in different ways.

anwi creates the **Selhae** . selhae souls work inwards, towards the core of the self. selhae resonate with **Soul** -type dust. the selhae received two gifts from anwi: **Construction**, which allows the selhae to create constructs by using a piece of their soul, and **Soul Archetypes**, which provide the selhae with unique powers and abilities determined by the resonance of their soul

wefa creates the **Fae** . fae souls work outwards, towards the elements. fae resonate with **Essence** -type dust. the fae similarly received two gifts from wefa: **Shapeshifting**, which allows the fae to take on many forms, and **Elemental Magic**, which provides fae with the ability to manipulate elements that resonate with their soul.

at first, anwi and wefa play a very active role on asilles. the selhae and fae regard the inna as gods. however, as more inna are creating planets, anwi and wefa are needed more often to do their job for the seedkeepers. as time passes, they get very attached to their creations and don’t want them to have to all perish when the planet wanes and their new inna baby blooms, so they figure out a plan to save the life on the planet before it dies - they construct two guardians to watch over the planet and assist when the time came.

**Merisdae**  - will choose a selhae to guide the people to the moons, and **Yudora** - will choose a fae to establish life on the moons.

# **asilles arc**

a looong time later, (like tens or hundreds of thousands of years later or smth), asilles begins to wane naturally, signaling the end of the planet’s lifespan. this happens very slowly. it isn’t really noticable by the people on asilles, but they might start noticing that the waning of dust from the planet is affecting their crops, etc.

emeut finds out about anwi and wefa’s plan to save the people of asilles and decides to sabotage them because that is Wrong and disrupts the balance of the universe (and also because he wants revenge). however, due to his dust being taken from him, he doesn't have much power left. he decides he will take **Atis**, one of his follower’s long dead and neglected planets, and ~~chuck it at asilles~~ send it on a course directly into asilles, destroying the planet, the selhae and the fae, and the growing inna. compared to asilles, atis is small - but large enough to do major damage to the planet. it is more comparable in size to an asteroid or a moon. he doesn't do this immediately, since at this point anwi and wefa are much more powerful than him. they would need to be out of the way for him to enact his plan.

meanwhile, due to asilles’ dust waning, a panic in losing their crops and resources and needing to obtain more means of production kickstarts the selhae kingdom of **Solei** to begin taking over more settlements (and in turn, kickstarts the **Kohoii/Solei War**)

**Kulith** is born in solei, and at a young age is discovered by the solei government for her abnormally high concentration of dust and strong powers of manipulating sound waves. as a child, kulith is ~~stolen~~ bought from her parents and is used as a weapon in the war. notably, she is used in an attack on **Kohoii**, which kills **Naediia** - Esela's mother.

**Esela** was born in **Kohoii**, a small village headed by her grandmother **Reika** . after her mother passed in the conflict with solei, reika raised esela on her own to be next in line to lead kohoii. esela cared deeply about the village, but didn't feel that she was fit to be its leader. esela spends a lot of her time in a place she calls the **Maeniil** - "sanctuary" in varae - a clearing in the woods near kohoii known only to her.

years after the attack on kohoii, when kulith and esela were adults, kulith is able to escape solei and runs away. she stumbles upon esela in the maeniil and esela agrees to help hide kulith when solei inevitably comes looking for her. the two of them get super close ~~and super gay for each other~~
one day, esela decides to bring kulith to kohoii, to show her the village she was meant to lead. kulith was apprehensive, knowing that kohoii and solei were at war - but trusted esela and wanted to learn about the village she was forced to attack from such a young age.

however, reika, being around for the entirety of solei's oppression, attempted annexation, and attacks, did not have the brightest outlook when it came to people from the kingdom to begin with - but reika recognized kulith as the girl who killed her daughter. knowing this sealed kulith's fate to reika. furious, reika sends kulith away and tells esela what kulith had done all those years ago.

esela is (fairly) super distraught and runs to the maeniil, only to find kulith waiting for her. the two of them talk and kulith explains that she was used against her will, and that's why she had run away. after a lot of consideration, esela forgives her, and they decide to run away from kohoii to be together.

soon after this, merisdae chooses esela as the selhae guide, linking merisdae and esela’s souls.

years pass, and esela and kulith settle down in **Yuvomne** and have their daughter, **Kaeyomii**. at a young age, kaeyomii began seeing visions of **Atis** and the destruction of the planet. kaeyomii tells esela and kulith about these visions, but as they are unaware of her rare archetype/powers at this time, they believe she is just an imaginative child and don't give it much thought. however, through her link to esela, merisdae is made aware of atis and of kaeyomii’s ability to see into the future.

merisdae realizes that she needs help in order to attempt to save asilles from the impact of the debris - or at least perform damage control and make sure as little damage is done as possible. she knows, through her link with esela, that esela has teleportation abilities and kaeyomii can see the future. she also knows yudora has [insert special barrier/blast powers here]. her plan is to recruit esela, kaeyomii and yudora and amplify their abilities.

kaeyomii, being able to see the debris impact happen ahead of time, would inform the group of the location of impact so they can focus their efforts. amplified by merisdae - clearer visions

esela would teleport the group close to the impact site, and work to evacuate anyone in danger away from the site. amplified by merisdae - further teleportation range

yudora would blast the debris away, hopefully either breaking the debris into smaller pieces, or, preferably, pushing the debris far enough away that it would no longer fall to asilles at all. amplified by merisdae - stronger blast

the group is teleported right outside the blast radius, with kaeyomii’s navigational help. esela and kulith leave kaeyomii in what they believe to be a safe hiding spot outside of the range of the impact, and tell her not to leave no matter what until they come back. esela and kulith work on evacuating anyone living in the danger zone, and yudora and merisdae get prepared to blast the meteor away.

emeut, already upset that his meteor missed, interferes further and speeds up the debris. doing this is much riskier to him - throwing atis from afar would ensure he was not caught when anwi and wefa returned, but getting this close to the planet made it hard to dismiss the blame. kaeyomii didn’t see this in any of her visions, so it was not accounted for.

panicking, yudora and merisdae get ready to blast the debris away, but… the blast is not strong enough, and the debris simply resumes falling back to the planet… some falling directly to where kaeyomii was hiding.

the debris impacts with asilles.

with moments to spare, merisdae is able to reach kaeyomii at the impact site and, while she's not able to save her physical form, merisdae absorbs kaeyomii's soul into her own. merisdae and yudora are deconstructed by the force of the impact, leaving only the **Moonband** and **Starlight Crystal?** behind. esela and kulith, now outside of the blast radius, survive the impact.

anwi and wefa return to asilles. they catch emeut, who is at this point fading out of existence. in his final words to anwi and wefa, emeut tells them of his suspicion that hafei is taking inna’s dust for himself, to make himself stronger and live forever.

with esela’s link to merisdae, she knows that something went wrong and that she needs to go find kaeyomii. when they get back to the impact site, they’re unable to find even kaeyomii’s body in the rubble. the two are devastated at the loss of their child and to the destruction of the planet.

however, esela finds the moonband and reconstructs merisdae with her own soulpiece. she returns in her “simpler” form, due to no longer having an inna’s soulpiece.
kulith finds the starlight crystal and reconstructs yudora with her own soulpiece as well, who also returns in a simpler form.

anwi and wefa, now fully able to see what has happened to their planet, their world seed - see that the impact of the debris has accelerated the death of the planet. this means the dust on the planet will be increasingly absorbed into the seed, until nothing is left and the seed blooms into a new inna. merisdae and yudora see this as well, and know that it is time for them to perform the duties they were constructed to do, and migrate the population of asilles up to its moons.
