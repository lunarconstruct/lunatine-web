    following kulith. she wakes up and is like “okay i am getting out of here today this is the day its gonna happen”
    
    does she know how she’s gonna get out?? i think in order for me to give her a planned escape i need to set in stone like. where the hell she is like physically in space
    
    she basically “belongs” to the solei government?? military??
    
    im trying to think of like. what kind of thing is going on here
    
    maybe i gotta figure out solei’s deal altogether
    
    i’m gonna say. solei is run by a king or something. hes not like super plot relevant, he is mostly just a product of the environment. if that makes sense.
    
    he’s just normal evil and not villian evil fjksdfjksdfj
    
    but as kingdoms be they are sometimes empires, where they wanna rule a bunch of things
    
    king man wants to take over a bunch of villages and be like “ur under my rules now”
    
    but they’re like :/ dont do that
    
    now what kind of defense do these little villages have to defend themselves against an empire?? why did solei have to find a superpower child to fight ur battles?? what battles are u even fighting??
    
    like an empire has an *army.* a kingdom has an army
    
    but a village MAYBE has a small militia if its big enough like a town
    
    but kohoii is not really a big town theyre a little village with a bunch of peaceful people in it
    
    maybe instead of it being like this full on attack of the village, it was an assassination?
    
    like they sent kulith to *specifically* kill eselas mom?? that would be a CRAZY different thing to imply and to Esela
    
    but it makes more sense??
    
    maybe eselas mom was against the king but like high profile somehow
    
    and the king is like “we don’t need those kind of rumors going around” and sends one of his child soldiers to kill her
    
    maybe the original idea isnt to literally kill her is that dramatic lmfao
    
    but she does end up dying so
    
    it makes more sense this way to for reika to have seen kulith actually kill naediia
    
    but now its back to like. why did kingman decide he needed superpower children to do this?
    
    he can just send a knight to her house and she would Become Stabbed but maybe he didn’t want this to be known?? like hes not tryna see that the king is just assassinating “innocent” people (he doesn’t think they are)
    
    maybe kulith’s soundwave powers were fatal but like. how r u gonna prove that this child just came up to you and vibrated u at such a specific frequency that u Died
    
    so its literally like. a silent killer fksdjfksd
    
    kulith really had to have been brainwashed for her to just be killing people on command
    
    is she resistant to this inundation at any point??
    
    like when they first take her, is she like refusing to cooperate? or do they take her at just the right age to create a killing machine ;;
    
    this is becoming much more Violent lmfao
    
    but how many political targets could this king have?? that he would have to imprison this child for like 18 years to have her brainwashed into killing them?
    
    maybe hes got some ulterior motive but then like. i feel like he would have a bigger part in the story but hes really not relevant past kulith’s backstory
    
    salem suggested that maybe it was just a wrong place, wrong time kind of scenario
    
    like, kulith was in a transport that was going thru/near kohoii and naediia’s anti-imperialist group was like lets GET em
    
    a fight breaks out and maybe kulith attacks her out of self defense?? or the guards are like “okay kulith these are the bad guys we have been teaching u abt GET em”
    
    either way, it kills naediia. but then how does reika know. was she there? it must have been in a high visibility part of kohoii, reika is getting old, she’s not going out into the woods and participating in raids
    
    but if it happened like in town, then reika would have seen kulith kill naediia and that part of the lore is explained
    
    then another question, why is king man collecting these high dust individuals anyway and transporting them all over
    
    one thought is that he wants to take over acorithe, a large, powerful, and affluent fae kingdom
    
    the fae all have elemental powers, and fae with tier three and four resonances can be Very dangerous
    
    so maybe kingman is just trying to build an army of selhae with similar levels of powers in order to stand a chance
    
    seran has suggested that maybe the fae kingdom has this relic that kingman is trying to get to
    
    and the relic can only be found by selhae with a core archetype?? specifically kulith would be perfect to find it bc it could like call to her and kulith can manipulate the soundwaves to find where its coming from or smth
    
    it could be a combination of the wrong place wrong time thing where kulith just happens to be in the wrong place and kills eselas mom, but her main use for solei was actually supposed to be to get this relic thing that the fae currently have
    
    maybe this relic comes into play later too?? does it have smth to do with the inna 👀
    
    after meteor shit happens kulith is like “wait i remember i can find this relic and maybe it can help us”
