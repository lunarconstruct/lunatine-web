The act of creating a [Soul](Soul%20f5650c5d3be2487194e629cc898ca601.md) or [Essence](Essence%20175c5cb610f580449e11d1751073f30c.md) out of concentrated [Dust](Dust%20e5dd6dcde4974c6ca3920c91cad7c2cb.md). This is an ability that is unique to the [Inna](Inna%2099642857c4464973a4612f6533cb754d.md).

[Selhae](Selhae%20822e316012e74ddba8bb5c6faf31fe66.md) can use the power of [Construction](Construction%20aefd8cb2a0184071a880b20e5ad2d552.md), which is related to creation in that the user takes a soulpiece from their own soul and combines it with essence to make a [Construct](Construct%2038fe566bb96341be8aa944ee36e73b6d.md), however these are not complete souls being created and thus is a construction rather than a creation.
