# Construction

tags: magic

The act of creating a living being, by imbuing an inanimate object ([Essence](Essence%20175c5cb610f580449e11d1751073f30c.md)) with a soulpiece from the creator’s [Soul](Soul%20f5650c5d3be2487194e629cc898ca601.md). The soulpiece and magic are then pulled out of the object, resulting in a living being that can take on almost any form the creator wishes, including humanoid, animal, and mythical creature forms.

Construction is a sub-type of [Creation](Creation%20514a94ac18e24c60b6ca42ca5f194015.md) magic, which focuses more on imparting a soul into an object than creating the soul itself.

Construction requires more of a “ritual” than Creation as well, as the object being turned into a construct must be crafted. For example:

[Merisdae](Merisdae%2096ee77d2a5d24d1aa718c98ca012d365.md) - Construct of Moon. a piece from each of the Asilles moons were collected and crafted into the [Moonband](Moonband%2091567d1e97bb4b53be7fc62690dab52f.md), and imbued with a soulpiece.

[Canel**é**](Canel%C3%A9%20612d94fd73f942e5be783bbe6b2327f8.md) - Construct of Stardust. Stardust was collected and crafted into a [Stardust Gem](Stardust%20Gem%205239387ffc9e4ae7ab38f0a539393e81.md), then imbued with a soulpiece.

[Osuhii](Osuhii%20216c5cb610f58035be79f4b328d83e0a.md) - Construct of Riverstone. Stones from the Kohoii River were collected and polished into beads, then made into a bracelet. The bracelet was imbued with a soulpiece.

It is not a separate process for the soulpiece to be added, but rather, through the act of crafting these objects, they intrinsically retain a piece of the creator’s soul. “i put my heart and soul into it” but real. It does have to be intentional though, no accidental constructs.

If the crafted object is damaged or destroyed, the soulpiece is released and attempts to return to its original soul. If merely damaged, the object may be repaired with intent and the construct can be re-constructed.

In the case of [Merisdae](Merisdae%2096ee77d2a5d24d1aa718c98ca012d365.md), the moonband was damaged in the [Debris Impact](Debris%20Impact%20ed20ff388be6470196280bfd47d06e5d.md), but [Esela](Esela%207a0dac9b9d0f422489c6e9609eef84a6.md) repaired the headband with pieces from the new moon and re-constructed Merisdae. Because the soulpiece is different from Merisdae’s original Inna soulpiece, she comes back in a different, simpler form.
