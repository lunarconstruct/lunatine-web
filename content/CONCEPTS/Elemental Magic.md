as fae [Soul](Soul%20f5650c5d3be2487194e629cc898ca601.md)s work outwards towards the [Dust](Dust%20e5dd6dcde4974c6ca3920c91cad7c2cb.md)  in the world, their elements follow a hierarchy - starting at fire, and working out to arcane/dust, the higher tiers are more in tune with the dust in the environment.

## elemental resonance

a fae is born with a resonance to a certain element. this resonance determine s what element they are capable of manipulating. in the tiers higher than tier one, all tiers beneath it are inherited as well  - meaning someone with a nature resonance would also be able to manipulate water, fire, and electricity on top of being able to manipulate nature.

1. a tier one resonance (to water, fire, or electricity) is the most common. being the core elements, all fae are able to manipulate at least one of these, if not all three (tier 2+)
2. a tier two resonance (to air, earth, or nature) is the second most common - but still not very rare whatsoever. it inherits tier one elements.
3. a tier three resonance (to dark or light) is uncommon, but not rare. it inherits tier two and tier one elements.
4. a tier four resonance is very rare. the only element in this tier is arcane. fae with arcane resonance are resonant to all types of dust in their environment, and can manipulate it.
