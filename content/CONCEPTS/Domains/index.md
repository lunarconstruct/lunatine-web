all domains are defined as **kingdoms** or **independent settlements.** 

1. **kingdoms** are domains comprised of multiple villages, towns, or cities. they are usually monarchal, with one leader such as a queen, prince, etc.

2. **independent settlements** are small villages or towns that grew from the settlement of a clan of Selhae. they are usually run by the clan that founded it, as a council. the elder of the clan is usually the head of the council.

all domains are different in their ambitions, but some are more imperial than others and wish to conquer smaller settlements to expand their reach.
