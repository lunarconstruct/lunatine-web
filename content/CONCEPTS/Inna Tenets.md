### The Inna Tenets

1. **Neglect not the garden you have sown.**
    - *Care for your creations.*
    1. World seeds must not be neglected or treated badly. It can result in a weak, hurt Inna, which is cruel to the Inna and to the Expanse.
2. **Creation leads to Endings, and Endings lead to Beginnings.**
    - *The cycle of created life must be respected.*
    1. All dust taken from the expanse must return to the expanse. Dust contributed to a world seed must return to the Inna that blooms from it.
3. **Honor the connections between Inna.**
    - *All threads are connected.*
    1. Conflict between Inna is meaningless. All Inna work toward the same goal, and all Inna are connected through Dust.
