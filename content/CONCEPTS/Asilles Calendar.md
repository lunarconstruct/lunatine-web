# Asilles Calendar

[Asilles](Asilles%2079f784ab6fd945de9a6813c70677d52e.md) uses a standardized 13 month calendar, each month with 30 days. This adds up to a total of 390 days in a year. Each month has three weeks of 10 days each. 

The first nine weekdays are named after the elements, and the last weekday is named after the [Inna](Inna%2099642857c4464973a4612f6533cb754d.md). The weekdays are as follows:

- Hiitothe (lit. “water day”)
- Dothe (lit. “fire day”)
- Muthuthe (lit. “electricity day”, “lightning day”)
- Samthe (lit. “wind day”)
- Athe (lit. “ground day”, “earth day”)
- Yomiithe (lit. “life day”)
- Aemthe (lit. “darkness day”)
- Daethe (lit. “light day”)
- Pakamthe (lit. “dust day”)
- Iinyathe (lit. “Inna day”)

The calendar starts at year 1, the year that [Anwi](Anwi%20af7e2c72103f45cdbee264ff6beb0e57.md) and [Wefa](Wefa%200d386a3f0d714b369130ebed9c6f58cd.md) created the [Selhae](Selhae%20822e316012e74ddba8bb5c6faf31fe66.md) and the [Fae](Fae%200d82fa7326324372a247af4a753935ff.md). Asilles had been around for thousands of years at this point, and referring to a date before year 1 is done with negative numbers. (i.e. 1/1/-200)

When the calendar was first created, the Selhae and the Fae were still intertwined in one society, speaking [Varae](Varae%20cbf0bf7060c841f8a0858a33fab063a6.md). Therefore, even though the fae are now isolated from the Selhae, and speak mainly [Acorithe](Acorithe%2093699d02d79b4f0db0e8b98338ae6330.md), the fae still use the same calendar as the Selhae, including the Varae names.
