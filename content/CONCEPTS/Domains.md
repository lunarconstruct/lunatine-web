# Domains

all domains are defined as **kingdoms** or **independent settlements.** 

1. **kingdoms** are domains comprised of multiple villages, towns, or cities. they are usually monarchal, with one leader such as a queen, prince, etc. 
    1. i.e. kingdom of [Acorithe](Acorithe%20d00318519255486fac9251972b7a558e.md) ruled by [Colarius](Colarius%208749d61b772b40d8adeb552f1ad6af5e.md), prince
2. **independent settlements** are small villages or towns that grew from the settlement of a clan of [Selhae](Selhae%20822e316012e74ddba8bb5c6faf31fe66.md). they are usually run by the clan that founded it, as a council. the elder of the clan is usually the head of the council.
    1. i.e. village of [Kohoii](Kohoii%205ec34e8227ec4373998d026fd09ee730.md), ruled by [Reika](Reika%20c3f81d2257d84c019e43faa2f13a035c.md), kohoii clan elder.

all domains are different in their ambitions, but some are more imperial than others and wish to conquer smaller settlements to expand their reach.

1. this situation is what started the [Kohoii/Solei War](Kohoii%20Solei%20War%203650a8f12f42430cbb47a319975bca7a.md), as the kingdom of [Solei](Solei%20a43736a3946f491ab5b40ad8e7fab381.md) attempted to annex the neighboring settlement of [Kohoii](Kohoii%205ec34e8227ec4373998d026fd09ee730.md). 

### education across domains

1. settlements will often have small schoolhouses for children, but more likely than not will not have any kind of upper/continued education for adults.
2. larger kingdoms will likely have upper education in larger cities such as the capitol, as well as schoolhouses for children in smaller towns and villages.
3. curriculum varies depending on the domain, as domains have differing ideals that they want to impart on their children.
    1. i.e. a kingdom may focus on academia or military education, whereas an independent settlement may focus on agriculture or other trades.
    2. fae-majority domain schools will often have a heavy focus on [Elemental Magic](Elemental%20Magic%201e28080c781f4f84a9e691b3836dd7be.md)
