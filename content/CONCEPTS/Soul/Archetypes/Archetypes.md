Each soul resonates with an “archetype”, determining their natural “gifts” or “abilities”. These gifts are magic in nature, providing the user abilities one would not have without the same archetype. These come from resonating with specific types and amounts of Dust in ones soul. The more Dust you resonate with, the more powerful these abilities become.

There is a sort of hierarchy (not social, but metaphorical) of the archetypes, since some are more “powerful” than others. It can be visualized as a circle, the further inward you get (closer to the core of your soul) the more powerful your magic is, both within your ring and within the whole circle.
