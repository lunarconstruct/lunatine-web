The makeup of a being’s soul can be thought of in layers. Generally, the way this appears is with a smaller, compressed Soul **core** within an outer Essence **shell**. 

Inna are beings made purely of Soul dust. They contain no Essence, and thus do not have a physical form.

Selhae and Fae follow the most common structure of being. This is a soul, surrounded by essence that provides a physical form and appearance to the being.

Constructs are similar to the Selhae and Fae, except their soul is incomplete. The soul dust within them, on its own, is not enough to facilitate life. So, it is supplemented with Essence. This is unique to constructs, and cannot be done to normal Selhae or Fae souls.

- Inna only have a soul and no physical appearance.
- Selhae/Fae have a complete soul and a physical appearance
- Constructs have an incomplete soul but still have a physical appearance

The definition of an “incomplete” soul is not exact. It is more defined by how it affects the being the soul belongs to. The less dust a being has, the harder it becomes for the being to hold its form and retain said dust.
