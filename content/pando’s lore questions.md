    ### big questions:
    
    - **do inna die? how?**
        - general: this gives any inna a reason to not get punished in some way or do something that could result in their death
        - general: would explain the control in planet/universe expansion so that the growth isn’t so exponential

        - let’s just, for the sake of things, say they can die but it would not be for a Very Long time and it can be prevented if provided enough dust?
        - i.e. the dust within an inna will eventually wane, if all of an inna’s dust wanes the inna would just kinda fade out of existence. but powerful inna are able to absorb more dust when theirs begin to wane and so they can keep themselves alive for longer?
        - maybe the inna court/council thing is like. literally the most powerful innas that have been around since the beginning bc they keep absorbing more dust.
        - but then that brings up another question of how do they absorb the dust, and how is that ability limited to the most powerful inna? i think what needs to be figured out is How the inna control the dust within them - since that also effects the whole “taking away dust from an inna as punishment” thing
        - thinking the ability to absorb dust into ones soul might also explain the whole “merisdae absorbs kaeyomii into her soul somehow” thing too
        </aside>
        
    - **what do inna do aside from create planets (and more inna as a result)?**
        - general: gives inna a reason to not be staring at their planets 24/7, as well as a reason for inna to not make a bunch of planets and grow even more rapidly, something to do if an inna doesn’t want to make a planet
            - they take part in the [Seedkeeper Council](Seedkeeper%20Council%20162c5cb610f580c69ebdcdaed19868e3.md) and have jobs
        - lore-specific: anwi and wefa need a reason to not be around their planet while emeut’s causing problems
            - anwi and/or wefa are “world health inspectors” and go around making sure inna are taking proper care of their worlds
        - lore-specific: emeut probably had something he was doing when his planet was failing, neglect being his intention or not
            - nah he was just a piece of shit and got snitched on by anwi and wefa causing him to want revengeeeee
        - *brainstorming*
            - this one is really stumping me because we originally made the inna like. just as a creation mythos and not like an actual species with this much thought put into it. they were literally just supposed to be gods that made worlds and we left it at that
            - because like. what else is there to do in an infinite void besides make stuff to put in it and then play with them
            - but we established that the inna treat the worlds like their children/family so its like. u create a world to turn it into an inna and then the inna blooms and the world dies, now you’ve got another inna. so what? why do they want to do that?
            - i mean if your life only consisted of making a thing and then spending your entire life doing that one thing with Literally nothing else. Why would you keep doing it, why would you want to bring another one of yourself into the universe to be stuck to the same boring fate.
            - there HAS to be something that gives them motivation to keep procreating and making more worlds besides just “there’s nothing else to do” and i think that’s what we’re missing
            - inna Society at this point is just too Open-ended and Vague and it doesnt quite make sense why anyone follows the rules, let alone makes worlds to begin with. it feels like they need some sort of more Set society ykwim
            - **what if instead of just one big inna council, there was a kind of divide between philosophies of the inna and there are separate branches?**
                - for example, one branch believes that the world seeds and the worlds themselves are just means to an end for creating new inna, they see themselves as “higher” than the life on the planets
                - and then another branch may believe that the innas purpose is to put all kinds of life in the universe, so they put more effort and dust into keeping their planets alive and the life on their planets alive as long as possible
                - the former may still put some effort into the seeds to make sure the inna is well off, but dont really care for the life on the planet, just the inna that comes after
                - mayhaps anwi and wefa are of the latter philosophy but exist in an area that is primarily the former branch, which could be why they would be in trouble for trying to keep the life on their planet alive
                - this divide between branches could provide the inna with something to do too - arguing philosophy, starting conflict, etc
                - maybe The Original Inna is of one belief and it is kind of overpowering the other due to everyone believing that the original inna is like. the god of the gods so he must be right
                    - so the other branch(es) become more like rebellions/fringe groups trying to change the way the universe has been working?
                    - maybe where the original inna exists and the council exists is considered like the “center” of the universe and the further out you get the less Strict the governance is - so inna tend to grow planets there to escape persecution from the “ruling” branch ig?
                    - maaaaybe the world garden really is just a place at the center of the universe where the council is, and its where all the planets grow that are “Approved” by the council - but they can still grow elsewhere in the expanse but they have less dust to work with
                    - am i legit creating class divide amongst my inna fjdskfjdskfj
                - maybe there are some extremists 0 w0
                    - on one side, there could be inna that don’t care about blooming another inna out of their world seed, they just want to make a planet and take care of it and visit it and be overall very involved in its creation/life
                        - could use dust to prevent the world from coming to its natural end. this is against the [**Creation leads to Endings, and Endings lead to Beginnings.**](Inna%20Tenets%2015fc5cb610f5804f938fcacbffd4b55f.md)
                        - anwi and wefa would probably be leaning towards this end of the spectrum but they do still care about the inna that blooms, so not quite as extreme as some could be
                    - but on the other, there could be inna that don’t care about the life on their planet at all and only care about the inna that will bloom out of it
                        - could use dust to cause the world to accelerate the natural end of the world or to cause a premature end. this is also against the [**Neglect not the garden you have sown.**](Inna%20Tenets%2015fc5cb610f5804f938fcacbffd4b55f.md)
                        - emeut could definitely be one of these extremists. could explain why he got in so much trouble. maybe he was a leader in the movement or smth?
                            - maaaaybe he used to be a strong and powerful inna with a lot of dust and he used it to essentially fund extremists to create a shitton of planets to neglect and turn into shitty inna lmfao
                            - could be why they took his dust, maybe its not a common punishment but it made sense in his case
                        - i should figure out why they would want to just make a metric fuckton of inna with no purpose lmfao
    - ***how does the court take away an inna’s dust? does this take away their power? what do they do with the dust when it’s taken away? how severe does the crime/action have to be to warrant dust being taken away? how much gets taken?**
        - general: gives a punishment that inna probably don’t want and try to avoid
        - general: can set up a few different future scenarios based around the court
        - lore-specific: if emeut did something bad (his planet failing) and was punished in this way, it gives him motivation

    ### smaller questions (may not be canon ideas, just questions i have)
    
    - **what happens when an inna dies? if an inna has a greater amount of dust, would their death be greater than an inna born from a more desolate planet?**
        - if it’s something that can be seen or cause damage, could set up for future or past plot ideas
    - **what happens to a planet when it blooms into an inna? what happens to the constructs around the planet that don’t get absorbed? what happens to that solar system?**

### on the topic of world seeds:

**how exactly are the seeds created? if it is physically created with essence, and then given a soul specifically from an inna to become working world seed, what amount of this is necessary? like a whole lot of essence? a whole of soul? would it take a substantial amount of either to make a world seed? it would make it harder to make them and then easier to regulate the amount of world seeds created (i think a thing that i keep saying but keeps getting glossed over in favor of a different topic is the regulation of world seeds to keep things from growing way way too fast, which is like, not a huuuuge deal but i think about it)**

- plus since inna can turn dust into soul dust anyway they can easily regenerate their own soul. tho i gotta work on that bc whats preventing any old inna from just taking a shitton of dormant dust just like sitting in the universe and making their soul hella strong? ive gotta make some sort of limitation to that
