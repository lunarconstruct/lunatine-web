# pando’s character analysis??

### lia’s analysis

esela is next in line but is afraid, though not enough to betray her duties (yet) and kulith is this child soldier that just got out of her binds, great start

esela i assume has barely left her village, so she knows people, or would i assume is at least very close to a few

this is what i assume keeps her around

and now kulith has no idea where she is, i assume (how much of the land does she know if she just fights the battles?) and needs help from this person who only really knows her own village, so that's the only idea of a place to take a look at and hopefully figure out what to do next (this gives kulith another reason to go to kohoii) 

the chunks between this and any other significant event is probably exposition of character - bonding, learning about the characters as individuals instead of just who they are around each other, the good stuff

esela falling in love makes sense if she's a romantic, a chance meeting with a stranger in her hut is perfect for her 

but her struggles with the relationship probably come from being torn between that and her village and responsibilities, how easy is all of that to let go after it's been laid out in front of you for your entire life?

bc kulith was bought and used as a weapon, how much free will and thought did she have for herself?? it's mind-numbing stuff, so i imagine her emotions get easily subdued, and even when she feels them, who's even listening?

i'd think that opening up takes time, even in the time that they spend learning about each other in the hut before the festival, how much is kulith *really* gonna open up about?

how can someone like that trust others, and if she's unwilling to open up enough, how is esela even falling for her anyway?

i think it kinda depends on kulith's personality at this point in time, just after escaping

is she trying to open up and be trusting of others? or is she closed off and edgy bc she's only known violence for so long?

it could be a mix of both, and these clashing feelings of hers make it difficult for her to express herself more than it already is

and it could give esela mixed signals

but i imagine kulith isn't coming right out and going "yeah so i'm a murderer"

i mean she could

but i think that is not the direction you'd want to go if you want esela to be willing to talk to her

so she's holding back when they're getting to know each other in the hut, she has to tread carefully and listen to what she's saying bc if she trips up and this person she's beginning to trust leaves her, then she's got no one again

this can be where she realizes she's feeling something, but is it a crush? does she know what that feels like? this has to be it, right? but really, how in love could she be when the other person is treating her in a way that they would to a non-murderer?

as far as feelings go, kulith could go back and forth on if her feelings are out of gratefulness and admiration or actual love

it's new to her, i'd assume, and after having to tamp down your feelings in order to fight, it can't be an easy thing to navigate

anyway, eventually they'll go to the festival, however you want to get them there

beyond that, idk where you're headed with plot, but at some point i imagine kulith's background gets revealed

i'm sure it's a big struggle for them both, bc kulith is now attached to esela, the only person she's really got and is slowly realizing she's scared to lose. she loses esela, she's literally lost all she has aside from some sick fighting skills

and esela now has a murderer she's fallen in love with, and that murderer happened to be there when her mom died and caused so much grief for the village she's grown up in and loves

lots to unpack between them

if this story is going *anywhere* esela is gonna have to forgive kulith, i assume with the trust that kulith has truly changed and isn't gonna go attacking her village again

and kulith is gonna be real stressed about this for a while, bc all of these feelings don't just dissipate the moment you say them out loud

bc idk how the story unfolds, i can't say much more on what could happen

but kulith would get the most character development out of all this

i imagine by the time she's confessed about who she is and what she's done, she's a much more open person, at least to esela

and that esela's opened up to her as well

so then the whole running away thing

who brings it up?

esela? bc she's tired just from the idea of being the next elder? or kulith? bc she just wants to be with esela without the family hate?

my personal vote is esela, bc again, it gives kulith some more character development, but now esela has her time to shine with her struggles instead of kulith now

esela brings up the idea, albeit with her reservations, it's just an idea after all

kulith, as much as you might imagine is on board for this, cares about esela now

so why would she let the person she likes throw away the life she's lived?

kulith knows what it's like to be alone, but esela's always had people around her

esela can have the power and authority that kulith never had and lived under all her life, why shouldn't esela take what she can get?

now that kulith is more in tune with her feelings, at this point, we can finally see her express them

and they're all about esela

obviously

but esela's pretty set on not wanting to be the next elder, so they'll have to find a way around it

that is for you to figure out story wise

arguments, understanding, whatever needs to be done for esela and kulith to be like "okay we can run away without regrets, or at least not a lot of them" and skip off into the sunset

maybe they do leave with regrets, but they can go make up with reika later if they gotta (that's a whole other story i think)

### my analysis of the analysis

- esela is next in line to be village elder
    - she is afraid, but not enough to betray her duties (yet)
    - what keeps her around is the people of kohoii, she barely has left kohoii otherwise
- kulith is essentially a child soldier who just escaped
    - she doesn’t really know anything about where she is. she runs away but doesn’t know where she’s planning on running to, just away
- exposition of character
    - bonding
    - learning abt the characters as individuals instead of just who they are around each other
- esela is a romantic
    - she has a meetcute with a stranger in her little hideout and is like “destiny brought us together”
    - but she is also torn because her responsibilities with kohoii have been something that is very important for a long time in her life
- kulith was bought from her parents and used as a weapon for solei
    - didn’t have much free will
    - for a majority of her life she wasn’t allowed to have emotions, essentially
    - her emotions get easily subdued, and even when she feels them, who's even listening?
- how much is kulith gonna open up about?
    - at first she’s pretty aloof, grateful to esela for helping her hide but is not very open about her past
    - esela’s more open and kind nature kind of gets through kulith’s walls a bit, and she starts opening up a little over time
    - kulith had been very closed off for her whole life and shes decided that she needs to change for her own sake and let others in
    - she's holding back when they're getting to know each other in the hut
    - she has to tread carefully and listen to what she's saying bc if she trips up and this person she's beginning to trust leaves her, then she's got no one again
- when feelings start arising
    - esela accepts them easily but doesn’t want to overstep and tries to hide it a bit, but is really bad at it
    - kulith on the other hand doesn’t really know what she’s feeling because she’s never really experienced anything like it before
    - kulith goes back and forth on if her feelings are out of gratefulness and admiration or actual love
    - its kinda the first test of letting herself feel things and not supressing them
- festival time
    - this is gonna be like, the culmination of things and i think where i want to have one of them confess to the other or smth
    - it can be a big bonding thing and kulith is finally seeing kohoii, which is very important to esela
    - i think at this point kulith is finally like. dang if she is so attached to this place she deserves to know what i did
    - but maybe reika finds them before kulith gets a chance to tell her, and esela finds out from reika instead of kulith
- conflictttttt
    - esela is upset about what kulith did and that kulith didn’t tell her herself
    - reika bans kulith from returning to kohoii and says that esela cannot see her anymore
    - kulith fuckin books it so as not to be turned in or captured by reika or anything. she needs to be free she cannot get herself in trouble again
    - esela is hella upset and goes to be alone in the maeniil and criesss
    - kulith shows up and they have a Talk ™️… kulith explains everything that happened that was beyond her control bc she was essentially brainwashed
    - esela is upset obviously but still has feelings for kulith regardless and knows that she can’t avoid them
    - kiss..? :pweasey:
- esela decides to keep hiding kulith at the maeniil. reika doesn’t know about this still so kulith is safe there
    - but that safety doesn’t last long because soren finds the maeniil and kulith in the hut and snitches to reika
    - reika then makes soren go and destroy the hut (how? burning it??) while they arent there
    - esela and kulith come back to the maeniil to it destroyed (keep in mind this was like. esela’s ONLY safe space she built the hut with her mom and would be here like literally all the time)
    - esela freaks out and goes to reika, who admits that she had soren do it so she couldn’t keep hiding kulith from her
    - this is kinda the last straw and esela is like “i cant do this. i need to leave”
- esela brings up the idea to run away, albeit with her reservations
    - she loves kohoii but knows she is not ready to be the leader and can’t handle reika’s cruelty regarding kulith who she cares about a lot
    - kulith is hesitant because she knows that esela cares a lot about kohoii and doesn’t want her to just throw that away
    - kulith knows what it's like to be alone, but esela's always had people around her
    - esela can have the power and authority that kulith never had and lived under all her life, why shouldn't esela take what she can get?
    - kulith talks about this with esela and finally expresses her feelings a bit more
- they agree that they’ll leave, but maybe one day they’ll come back
    - spoiler alert they dont get to come back because it gets fucking decimated by a meteor :( oops :(
