Owns: World Garden (World%20Garden%205a6cfe0468e64efe8e9b097f621b0ca2.md)

The council that presides over all [Inna](Inna%2099642857c4464973a4612f6533cb754d.md) in order to maintain balance in [The Expanse](The%20Expanse%20aae43c29a9ac4e94b8043b45e9f63a0b.md) and hold up the [Inna Tenets](Inna%20Tenets%2015fc5cb610f5804f938fcacbffd4b55f.md) established by [Hafei](Hafei%20174c5cb610f580d88ee8cac629e93be4.md).

Made up of some of the most powerful Inna in existence, The Seedkeepers claim to rule over all Inna in the Expanse. However, as the Expanse is infinite, there are many Inna that travel far, far away from the Council’s watchful eyes to escape prosecution. These Inna often end up living in isolation.

### The Inna Tenets

1. **Neglect not the garden you have sown.**
    - *Care for your creations.*
    1. World seeds must not be neglected or treated badly. It can result in a weak, hurt Inna, which is cruel to the Inna and to the Expanse.
2. **Creation leads to Endings, and Endings lead to Beginnings.**
    - *The cycle of created life must be respected.*
    1. All dust taken from the expanse must return to the expanse. Dust contributed to a world seed must return to the Inna that blooms from it.
3. **Honor the connections between Inna.**
    - *All threads are connected.*
    1. Conflict between Inna is meaningless. All Inna work toward the same goal, and all Inna are connected through Dust.

## history

The council began in good faith, as Hafei genuinely wanted to preserve the balance of the Expanse and bring meaning to the universe. The Tenets and the roles in the council were centered around ensuring worlds grew into strong Inna and continuing the cycle of creation.

However, over time, Hafei became obsessed with ensuring that he would always be around to “protect” the Expanse. He did not believe that any other Inna had the right or the ability to do it, so it became clear to him that he must remain alive until the universe came to its end.

Punishments became more severe and more frequent. Breaking any of the Tenets ran the risk of one’s dust being taken from their soul, and the seized dust would then be absorbed by Hafei to extend his life. These punished Inna were left with little to no soul dust, and were unable to continue growing planets. Dying, and with no purpose, these Inna would often become wanderers until they faded out of existence.
