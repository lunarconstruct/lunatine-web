#### Council Elders
- **[[CHARACTERS/Reika/index\|Reika]] of the Levenkagaelii**
    - [[CHARACTERS/Esela/index\|Esela]] is next in line.
    - [[CHARACTERS/Naediia/index\|Naediia]] was meant to be the next elder (and would be around the same age as the other elders) before her death.
    - She is the oldest of the elders, the last elder of her generation.
    - Reika is extremely traditionalist, strict, and does not like to compromise.
- **[[CHARACTERS/Paeyiilos/index\|Paeyiilos]] of the Daerikagaelii**
    - [[CHARACTERS/Soren/index\|Soren]] is next in line.
    - Paeyiilos is more of a free spirit than Reika, less traditional.
- **[[CHARACTERS/Miire/index\|Miire]] (and unofficially [[CHARACTERS/Mare/index\|Mare]]) of the Gahinukagaelii**
    - Miire is the effective elder, being the older twin, but Mare assists their twin and will take over in the event something happens to Miire.
    - The two are joined at the hip and never leave each others sides, but tend to butt heads often in their ideals.
