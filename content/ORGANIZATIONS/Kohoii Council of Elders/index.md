#### Council Elders
- **[Reika](Reika%20c3f81d2257d84c019e43faa2f13a035c.md) of the Levenkagaelii**
    - [Esela](Esela%207a0dac9b9d0f422489c6e9609eef84a6.md) is next in line.
    - [Naediia](Naediia%20dc678366936e41f384da240a61708663.md) was meant to be the next elder (and would be around the same age as the other elders) before her death.
    - She is the oldest of the elders, the last elder of her generation.
    - Reika is extremely traditionalist, strict, and does not like to compromise.
- **[Paeyiilos](Paeyiilos%20232c5cb610f58053b867dfaa978e0bb3.md) of the Daerikagaelii**
    - [Soren](Soren%20210c5cb610f58063bfb8e9e4db45c7f5.md) is next in line.
    - Paeyiilos is more of a free spirit than Reika, less traditional.
- **[Miire](Miire%20232c5cb610f580769940f81f708307a6.md) (and [Mare](Mare%20232c5cb610f580e4ae12c46dffb70eb7.md)) of the Gahinukagaelii**
    - Miire is the effective elder, being the older twin, but Mare assists their twin and will take over in the event something happens to Miire.
    - The two are joined at the hip and never leave each others sides, but tend to butt heads often in their ideals.
