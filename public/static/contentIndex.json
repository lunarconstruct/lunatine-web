The heightened concentration of dust in Kulith’s Soul also influenced their appearance, giving them a blue tint to their pale skin, and ice blue hair.Kulith was captured and used by the Solei government as a weapon, and assisted Esela in the Crescentmoon migration, but was trapped on Asilles due to Esela’s power waning.\n\nPhysical Description\nGeneral Physical Condition\nBody Features\nFacial Features\nIdentifying Characteristics\n\npale, slightly blue tinted skin\n\nPhysical quirks\nSpecial abilities\nResonator’s Soul\nKulith’s magic centers around the ability to manipulate sound waves. When controlled and intentional, these powers can be used in benevolent ways such as making music and creating sound barriers for protection. However, due to its powerful and unpredictable nature, it can often be harmful - manipulating enough energy to create powerful blasts and even cause earthquakes. Using their powers in this way drains a lot of energy out of Kulith.\nApparel &amp; Accessories\n\nSpecialized Equipment\nMental Characteristics\nPersonal history\nFrom a young age, it was clear that Kulith was different from her peers. Her magic was hard to control, especially as a child, and thus became an issue very early on. She would get overstimulated or frustrated easily, making it harder and harder for her to keep her magic controlled.\nAs a child, authorities in Solei pressured Kulith into using their magic in attacks on Kohoii during the Kohoii/Solei War. This unfortunately resulted in the death of Naediia, Esela’s mother. Kulith was never told about the casualties of these attacks, and both her and Esela don’t know that it was Kulith who killed Naediia. Reika, being the elder of Kohoii, was aware of this, which heavily contributed to her vehement disapproval of Kulith and Esela together.\nKulith worked to escape Solei, no longer wanting to be used as a weapon in such a malicious war. Finally, in 1220 they were able to escape, and came across Esela in the Maeniil. The two fell for each other instantly, and Esela hid Kulith in the Maeniil away from her grandmother’s judgmental eyes.\nEducation\nEmployment\nAccomplishments &amp; Achievements\nFailures &amp; Embarrassments\nMental Trauma\n\nwas taken away from parents at a young age\nwas used as a weapon in an unjust war (Kohoii/Solei War)\nlost her child in the Debris Impact\nseparated from their partner Esela and stranded on a dying planet\n\nIntellectual Characteristics\nMorality &amp; Philosophy\nSexuality\nGender Identity\nTaboos\nKnown Languages\nKulith is native and fluent in Varae.\nPersonality Characteristics\nMotivation\n\nfrom springhole, “More than anything, your character wants to escape a restrictive situation.”\n\nFamous Quotes &amp; Catchphrases\nSavvies &amp; Ineptitudes\nLikes &amp; Dislikes\nVirtues &amp; Personality perks\nVices &amp; Personality flaws\nPersonality Quirks\nHygiene\nSocial\nContacts &amp; Relations\nFamily Ties\nKulith was taken away from her family at a young age.

The soulpiece and magic are then pulled out of the object, resulting in a living being that can take on almost any form the creator wishes, including humanoid, animal, and mythical creature forms.\n\nConstruction is a sub-type of Creation magic, which focuses more on imparting a soul into an object than creating the soul itself.\nConstruction requires more of a “ritual” than Creation as well, as the object being turned into a construct must be crafted. For example:\nMerisdae - Construct of Moon. a piece from each of the Asilles moons were collected and crafted into the Moonband, and imbued with a soulpiece.\nCanelé - Construct of Stardust. Stardust was collected and crafted into a Stardust Gem, then imbued with a soulpiece.\nOsuhii - Construct of Riverstone. Stones from the Kohoii River were collected and polished into beads, then made into a bracelet. The bracelet was imbued with a soulpiece.\nIt is not a separate process for the soulpiece to be added, but rather, through the act of crafting these objects, they intrinsically retain a piece of the creator’s soul. “i put my heart and soul into it” but real. It does have to be intentional though, no accidental constructs.\nIf the crafted object is damaged or destroyed, the soulpiece is released and attempts to return to its original soul. If merely damaged, the object may be repaired with intent and the construct can be re-constructed.\nIn the case of Merisdae, the moonband was damaged in the Debris Impact, but Esela repaired the headband with pieces from the new moon and re-constructed Merisdae.

Dust came to be, alongside the first Inna, Hafei, to fill the void. From dust comes Essence and Souls. These two, along with dust in its pure form, make up the universe. Dust also sparks the powers of Creation and Construction.\nTypes of Dust\nPure Dust\nPure Dust is dormant dust, not being used for any sort of creation or magic. It lays inert in the universe, until a being uses it for Creation. This is dust in its default state.\nWhen dust is active and part of a being, it will always become either essence or soul. Beings cannot absorb or hold onto pure dust in its inert form.\nEssence\nEssence creates things with physical forms, but without magic or souls. It is created from pure dust.\nSouls\nSouls give life and sentience using magic. It is created from pure dust, highly compressed. These souls will attach themselves to dust (either in pure form or in the form of essence) and will create a living being.\nDust within Beings\nTo be considered “alive”, a being must possess enough Soul to hold themselves together, and support their life. Some beings also have essence to give themselves a physical form, but this is not necessary.\nEssence and soul do not mix, so generally the way this appears is with a smaller, compressed Soul core within an outer Essence shell.\n\na diagram showing the dust makeup of different beings. purple - soul, blue - essence\nInna are beings made purely of Soul dust. They contain no Essence, and thus do not have a physical form.\nSelhae and Fae follow the most common structure of being. This is a soul, surrounded by essence that provides a physical form and appearance to the being.\nConstructs are similar to the Selhae and Fae, except their soul is incomplete. The soul dust within them, on its own, is not enough to facilitate life. So, it is supplemented with Essence. This is unique to constructs, and cannot be done to normal Selhae or Fae souls.\nStability\nAll forms of dust essentially want to return back to this default, inert state, as it is the most stable. Over time, beings will slowly “lose” their soul dust or essence (known as “waning”), as it returns to its stable form as pure dust.\nIn terms of stability, pure dust is the most stable, then essence, then soul. So, since souls are the most unstable state for dust to be in, the soul will wane/lose dust before essence will.\nOther than gradually waning over time, using magic will also cause soul to wane.\nWhen the soul wanes completely, the being owning this soul dies. It has no soul, and is purely essence. Then, as there is no soul to hold the essence together, the essence begins to wane as well. When a being’s essence has completely waned, the being essentially disappears. It has no essence, or soul, and no longer Exists.\nStrength &amp; Magic\nIn general, the more dust a being has, the stronger it is. This could mean a lot of things - the being may be able to hold itself together better, and would wane slower. Its magic and abilities would also be stronger."},"CONCEPTS/Elemental-Magic/index":{"slug":"CONCEPTS/Elemental-Magic/index","filePath":"CONCEPTS/Elemental Magic/index.md","title":"Elemental Magic","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"magic used by the Fae that centers around the elements. this type of magic is solely used on manipulating the dust of elements in the outside world, and cannot be used to manipulate dust within a person or their soul.\nElements\nas fae Souls work outwards towards the Dust in the world, their elements follow a hierarchy - starting at fire, and working out to arcane/dust, the higher tiers are more in tune with the dust in the environment.\ntier one\nwater/ice\nadaptability, flow, and preservation\nfire/heat\npassion, destruction, and transformation\nelectricity\nenergy, speed, and precision\ntier two\nair/wind\nfreedom, communication, and the unseen\nearth/ground\nstability, endurance, and foundation\nnature/life\ngrowth, vitality, and connection\ntier three\ndark\nmystery, fear, and concealment\nlight\nclarity, revelation, and guidance\ntier four\narcane/dust\ntranscendence, omnipresence, and creation\nelemental resonance\na fae is born with a resonance to a certain element. this resonance determine s what element they are capable of manipulating. in the tiers higher than tier one, all tiers beneath it are inherited as well  - meaning someone with a nature resonance would also be able to manipulate water, fire, and electricity on top of being able to manipulate nature.\n\na tier one resonance (to water, fire, or electricity) is the most common. being the core elements, all fae are able to manipulate at least one of these, if not all three (tier 2+)\na tier two resonance (to air, earth, or nature) is the second most common - but still not very rare whatsoever. it inherits tier one elements.\na tier three resonance (to dark or light) is uncommon, but not rare. it inherits tier two and tier one elements.\na tier four resonance is very rare. the only element in this tier is arcane. fae with arcane resonance are resonant to all types of dust in their environment, and can manipulate it.\n"},"CONCEPTS/Essence/index":{"slug":"CONCEPTS/Essence/index","filePath":"CONCEPTS/Essence/index.md","title":"index","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"physical dust"},"CONCEPTS/Inna-Tenets/index":{"slug":"CONCEPTS/Inna-Tenets/index","filePath":"CONCEPTS/Inna Tenets/index.md","title":"index","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"\nNeglect not the garden you have sown.\n\nCare for your creations.\n\n\nWorld seeds must not be neglected or treated badly.

This is a soul, surrounded by essence that provides a physical form and appearance to the being.\n\nConstructs are similar to the Selhae and Fae, except their soul is incomplete.

It is created by another Inna using Dust and the power of Creation to create a Soul, as well as Essence to give it a physical form. These two components are then combined together using the power of Construction, leaving a world seed behind.\nAt it’s beginning, the seed is simply a small piece of the original Inna’s soul,  and doesn’t yet have enough soul to become an Inna with a complete soul. So, the Inna who created it (usually referred to as the “caretaker”) will tend to the planet as it grows. The caretakers will take dust from the universe and put it into/towards the seed indirectly by creating life and letting the planet flourish.\nThe world seed grows into a planet, leaving the seed at the core of the planet.\nThe world will go through its entire life cycle, and as it comes to its end, the dust in the Souls and the Essence of the planet begin to retreat back into the seed. Soul dust would be absorbed directly into the seed, but essence will return to its inert state as pure dust, and then is absorbed into the seed to be converted into soul dust as well.\nAfter all dust has been absorbed, the seed will be a hyper compressed pocket of soul that will “burst” and bloom into a newborn Inna.\nIn the event the seed is not provided with enough dust and care, the seed will not bloom when the world ends. The dust in the seed’s soul will wane, and the core of the planet will fall apart, causing the rest of the planet to follow suit. The essence used in its creation will not be pulled in / held together by the seed any longer, and will return to its inert state of pure dust. This takes a long time, and it would just be a barren, dissolving planet as it dies.\n\nAccording to the Inna Tenets, all dust that is taken from the universe to provide for a world seed must be allowed to be absorbed back into the world seed when its time comes. This is to keep the balance between Inna and the Expanse in check.\nHowever, there have been a few cases of civilizations on these planets becoming advanced enough to leave their planet, before the world begins to wane. This causes trouble for the Inna, because the world seed will only absorb the dust from Souls and Essence that is currently on the planet.\nSome Inna, to avoid persecution by the Seedkeeper Council, will influence their world’s cosmic explorers to return to the planet, to ensure their Dust returns to the seed before it blooms.\nOthers, if feeling bold enough, will attempt to allow their world’s space travelers to remain off-planet when the seed blooms, but this runs the risk of the traveler being caught or discovered by the Council, causing the caretaker to be punished severely."},"CONCEPTS/index":{"slug":"CONCEPTS/index","filePath":"CONCEPTS/index.md","title":"Concepts","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"EVENTS/Debris-Impact/Debris-Impact":{"slug":"EVENTS/Debris-Impact/Debris-Impact","filePath":"EVENTS/Debris

pronouns are gender neutral. plural pronouns are made by reduplication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsingularpluralfirst personvaii ”I”vaiivaii ”we/us”second personkoii ”you“koiikoii ”you all”third persondeii ”he/she/they/it”deiideii ”them all”\ncase system\nthis language only has one true case, that being the genitive case. the suffix fel is added to the end of the noun possessing the object.\n**&quot;selafel nuye&quot;\nsela-fel    nuye**\nflower-GEN  petal\n**&quot;**The flower&#039;s petals&quot;\n**&quot;niisafel saeka&quot;\nniisa-fel saeka**\nfire-GEN  color\n**&quot;**The color of the fire&quot;\na pseudo-case that varae also utilizes is in regards to the Inna - the god-like species that created the universe. when using pronouns in regards to them, the prefix iina is added. it acts as a sort of honorific, but is only utilized for the inna. generally, a person using this on themselves or another person would be thought of extremely negatively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsingularpluralfirst personiinavaii ”I”iinavaiivaii ”we”second personiinakoii ”you“iinakoiikoii ”you all”third personiinadeii ”he/she/they/it”iinadeiideii ”them all”\nplurality\nvarae generally does not express plurality. if the noun is countable, and the speaker wishes to specify how many of something there are, the speaker will generally just use numbers. in some cases, the noun can also be doubled to show there are many of something, but this is not always done.\nadjectives\nadjectives are always placed before the noun they are describing. for example, kumeiya leiv, “good dream”. a noun can also be used as an adjective by adding the affix ka to the end of the noun, for example, leiv, “dream”, becomes leivka, “dreamy”.\na note on adjectives in compound words (names only)\nadjectives will always end in /a/, and when compound words are created (i.e. for names such as yudora meaning “little star”), the /a/ at the end is dropped. in the event of a /ya/ ending, such as in uya - “young”, the /y/ is dropped as well, resulting in, for example, kumeileiv, a compound noun/name with the same meaning as kumeiya leiv, meaning “good dream”. dosa (red) + sela (flower) becomes dosela, as stated in the phonotactics, double consonants are not allowed in the same word. the double /s/ is reduced to a single /s/. however, please note that these compound words are mainly only used for names, and in normal speech and prose “red flower” would still be dosa sela.\nverbs\nverbs in dictionary/plain form end in sii. these verbs are in present tense, for example vaesii - ”to see/look”. verbs are not conjugated depending on gender or plurality, only tense and aspect.\nthere are three tenses - present, past, and future. to conjugate tense, the sii ending is replaced with a new ending depending on the tense - so for past, and se for future.\nthere are three aspects as well - plain, perfect, and continuous. for

purposes, it is romanized. the following rules are meant to adapt the written script into a more easily accessible format for learners and people interested in the world and its language.\nthe main speakers of varae are the Selhae, who have always had a very heavy focus on oral storytelling and music, as a culture. this means that the most common way something is passed along is verbally, and writing is not as common. some of these rules may seem unintuitive for long, detailed writing, but writing was generally reserved for preserving songs and stories, and communication between people (i.e. letters) - which all tended to be more poetic in nature.\nprose forms\nwhen written, periods are not used to mark the end of a sentence. instead, each new sentence is written on a new line.\ninstead of commas, written varae uses a tilde ~ to divide sentences into phrases/clauses. these are not always used depending on context, but are often added for clarity and when sentences become too long.\nlines can be broken off after a ~ or a { to prevent it from running off the page or simply becoming unreadably long. this is not necessary on all sentences, even if it has multiple clauses. when this is done, the continuation on the next line is indented so as not to be confused with a new sentence.\nin informal writing, or where it is not possible to break lines or indent, lines may be broken at any point and may not be indented. however, if this is done, any following lines must be separated with enough visual space to be able to tell where one line ends and another begins.\ndeii ~ otu vala dorafel anwaefa osu renaksii ~\n\tdorafel korliia dae weise nerasii veha\ntelasiira ~ deii yovela pahorii dala beirusii ~ \n\tna iinyaniilfel hiimana fa vahes meikasii\nota

in the World Garden, just as any planet did. Its caretakers, Anwi and Wefa, had been partners for a very long time.\nAs the world seed grew, life began to sprout - beautiful plant life and animals sprung up all across the planet. Anwi and Wefa decided that they had so much love for this planet, that they would gift to it sentient life as well. Anwi created the Selhae, and Wefa created the Fae - two sides of the same coin. They each had Souls, but each worked in a different way, with the Selhae’s working inwards towards the core of the soul, and the Fae’s working outwards towards the elements.\nLife prospered on Asilles for a very long time. Societies began, grew, and fell many times over. Eventually, Anwi and Wefa noticed the Dust within the planet beginning to wane. It is part of the natural cycle of a planet - from seed, to world, and finally to a fully bloomed, newly born Inna. The caretakers knew this would come eventually - it is what they set out to do in the first place. However, Anwi and Wefa had gotten more attached to the life on their planet than most Inna tend to.\nWhile most Inna see the world as a means to an end, just a step in the life cycle of the Inna, Anwi and Wefa saw it unfair that the people of Asilles would have to perish in order for them to create the new life they set out to create in the beginning. As the next, and last cycle of life began on Asilles, Anwi and Wefa created a plan.\nFrom each of the 4 moons circling the planet - Kuraesmeris, Hiitomeris, Buromeris, and Folmeris - the caretakers took a stone and embedded it into an artifact they called the Moonband. From this moonband, they constructed a guardian of sorts - a construct of Moon - Merisdae.\nThen, from the starlight that illuminated the planet, they created a gem of starlight. From this gem, they made a construct of Starlight - Yudora.\nMerisdae and Yudora’s task would be to watch over the people of Asilles until the planet’s end truly came. When the end was near, Merisdae would choose a Selhae to guide the people from Asilles to the moons, and Yudora would choose a Fae fit to assist with cultivating life on these moons."},"LOCATIONS/Asilles/albedo-and-temp.png.sidecar":{"slug":"LOCATIONS/Asilles/albedo-and-temp.png.sidecar","filePath":"LOCATIONS/Asilles/albedo and temp.png.sidecar.md","title":"albedo and

are magical beings created by the Selhae using the power of Construction. They come in many forms and can be made for various reasons, such as companionship or assistance.\nAbout\nConstructs are beings created by the Selhae. They are created by imbuing an inanimate object with a piece of the creator’s soul and a great deal of magic. The soulpiece and magic are then pulled out of the object, resulting in a living being that can take on almost any form the creator wishes, including humanoid, animal, and mythical creature forms.\nThese Constructs are incredibly versatile and can fulfill various roles, depending on the reason they were created. Traditionally, Constructs were created as assistants or companions to help with work or to travel with their creators. However, many Selhae now create Constructs solely for companionship, sometimes taking on the role of a child or a pet. Constructs can also be designed to serve specific functions, such as guarding or providing medical assistance.\nOne of the advantages of Constructs is their ability to learn and adapt. They possess a level of intelligence that allows them to understand and perform complex tasks. With proper training, they can even exceed the capabilities of their creators. Additionally, Constructs do not experience fatigue or illness, making them ideal for work that requires long hours or exposure to harmful environments.\nBasic Information\nAnatomy &amp; Morphology\nConstructs can take on any form the creator desires. This is however limited by the amount of magic put into making the construct. For example, only putting the bare minimum amount of magic into making a construct will only allow you to create a construct that is small, like the size of a rodent or small mammal.\nPerception &amp; Sensory / Extrasensory Capabilities\nConstructs are able to perceive and sense their surroundings based on the form they take. For example, if a construct takes on the form of a bird, it will have heightened vision and be able to fly. Constructs can also have extrasensory capabilities such as telepathy or the ability to sense magic, depending on the amount of magic imbued into them by their Selhae creator.\nGenetics &amp; Reproduction\nConstructs do not reproduce or have genetics in the traditional sense. Instead, their appearance and mannerisms are influenced by the soulpiece used to create them. The larger the soulpiece, the more the Selhae’s soul influences the construct’s traits. As a result, some constructs may resemble either the Selhae or those who were close to them, as a soul is composed of the people close to you.\nGrowth Rate &amp; Stages\nConstructs do not age at all. Since they are connected to their creator’s soul, once the creator dies, the construct will either die with the creator, or the creator can imbue the rest of their soul into the construct and the construct will live on, aging like a Selhae until it dies of natural causes.\nEcology &amp; Habitat\nConstructs do not have specific ecological or habitat needs since they do not require sustenance or a living environment. They exist solely to serve their Selhae creator, and their activities are generally limited to the tasks assigned to them. Constructs can travel with their Selhae creators, but they do not require a specific environment to survive.\nExtended\nAverage Intelligence\nConstructs possess a level of intelligence that allows them to understand and perform complex tasks. They can learn and adapt through proper training and can even exceed the capabilities of their creators.\nAverage Physique\nConstructs can take on any form the creator desires, depending on the amount of magic imbued into them. The more magic put into making a construct, the larger and more complex its form can be.\nUses, Byproducts and Exploitation\nConstructs are created to assist their Selhae creators in various tasks, such as work or travel. They are not exploited or used for any other purpose beyond their intended function.\nSapience\nHistory\nNaming Traditions\nMajor Organizations\nBeauty Ideals\nGender Ideals\nCourtship Ideals\nRelationship Ideals\nAttained Technological Level\nMajor Language Groups and Dialects\nCommon Etiquette\nDress Code\nCommon Customs and Observed Traditions\nTaboos\nMyths and Legends\nMajor Historical Figures\nInterspecies Relations"},"SPECIES/Fae/index":{"slug":"SPECIES/Fae/index","filePath":"SPECIES/Fae/index.md","title":"Fae","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"A species created by Wefa to live upon the planet Asilles.\nGeneric\nSouls &amp; Magic\nAnatomy &amp; Morphology\n\ntake on many forms due to Shapeshifting powers\ngenerally, default forms are humanoid with bug-like wings.\n\nPerception &amp; Sensory / Extrasensory Capabilities\nGenetics &amp; Reproduction\nGrowth Rate &amp; Stages\nEcology &amp; Habitat\nBiological Cycle\nDietary Needs &amp; Habits\nExtended\nGeographic Distribution\nAverage Intelligence\nAverage Physique\nFacial Characteristics and Features\nBody Tint, Coloring and Marking\nSocial Structure\nSapience\nHistory\nNaming Traditions\nMajor Organizations\nBeauty Ideals\nGender Ideals\nCourtship Ideals\nRelationship Ideals\nAttained Technological Level\nMajor Language Groups and Dialects\nCommon Etiquette\nDress Code\nCommon Customs and Observed Traditions\nTaboos\nMajor Historical Figures\nInterspecies Relations\nMyths and Legends\nDescendants of the original Fae created by  Wefa passed down The Story of the Inna.\nThe original fae were not so social as to create clans like their Selhae counterparts, so the Inna’s story is simply passed from parent to child.\nThe Fae believe that they were given Elemental Magic as a way to connect with the world created by the Inna.

Rarely do they visit these worlds in person, but on such occasions they will hide their true form and blend in among the locals, indistinguishable save for their planetary eyes.\nThe oldest Inna has been around since the beginning of the universe, made purely of index. They awoke to an empty void, The Expanse - and used their unique gift of index to give meaning to the universe. They created the indexs, ultra-compressed pockets of dust used to grow worlds, to plant in the World Garden. These World seeds become planets, and at the end of their lifecycle, the seed finally flowers - and a new Inna is born from the dying world.\nSince the first Inna, worlds have come and gone - planets once flourishing with life transformed into new Inna, who keep the cycle going. Traditionally, Inna are given permission by their caretakers - the Inna who planted their seed - to cultivate their own world seed, though this is not always the case. Some Inna choose not to grow worlds, and some go against their caretakers will and do so independently.\nInna rarely visit their worlds personally, and will sometimes create Constructs using the power of index on materials from their worlds to watch over their seeds for them.\nGeneric\nAnatomy &amp; Morphology\nThe Inna are large, abstract beings - created fully of index dust, they normally do not contain any Essence to provide them with a physical form that would be recognizable as a living creature. They are often depicted as clouds of dust, or galaxies full of stars, as they are made up of the universe.\nThey do have the ability to take on any form they wish. Sometimes, Inna will appear in the shape of the creatures on their world, and observe the planet from within.\nPerception &amp; Sensory / Extrasensory Capabilities\nInna have a unique gift of Creation, which they use to grow worlds from World Seed . Additionally, they have the power of Construction. Some Inna use this ability to create constructs to assist in tending to their seed.\nGenetics &amp; Reproduction\nInna are born from worlds at their end, which flower into new Inna. Traditionally, Inna are given permission by their caretakers - the Inna who planted their seed - to cultivate their own world seed, though this is not always the case. Some Inna choose not to grow worlds, and some go against their caretakers will and do so independently.\nInna will often grow worlds together with others they care about, such as a romantic partnership, a strong friendship, a sibling or family member. These units can be as small or as large as the Inna wishes - some Inna take the burden of creation on their shoulders alone, and some will grow their world seed together with the support of many others. Sometimes, multiple of these units will all grow seeds together in the same vicinity, and share resources like a sun.\nThe lifespan of the world/world seed depends on the Inna cultivating it. Some Inna do not care much for the world - only using it as a means to grow a new Inna. Some, however, care deeply about the world they create and see it as an important phase of the Inna cycle. These latter Inna may decide to create life on their worlds for this reason.\nWorlds grown by the former may appear bleak, desolate, and devoid of life. To these Inna, the world is a means to an end - what happens in between when the seed is planted and when the seed blooms doesn’t matter to them. The seed must still be given the bare amount of attention, as world seeds do have the possibility of dying before they can bloom.\nContrastingly, worlds grown by attentive and caring Inna will be lush, prospering worlds with animal and plant life - and occasionally sentient life as well if the caretakers wish. Some Inna believe that the better you care for the world seed, the more well-off the Inna will be when it is born.\nGrowth Rate &amp; Stages\n\nworld seed\n\nthe core of a world. super compact and powerful dust\n\n\ngrowing planet\nwaning planet\nbloomed inna\nwaning inna\n\ntheir dust will wane over time, causing the inna to weaken\npowerful inna are able to absorb more dust when theirs begin to wane so they can keep themselves alive for longer\n\n\ndeath\n\nif all of an inna’s dust wanes, the inna would fade out of existence.\n\n\n\nExtended\nAverage Intelligence\nAverage Physique\nFacial Characteristics and Features\nSocial Structure\nSapience\nHistory\nNaming Traditions\nInna are named by their caretakers upon their birth.

Physically, Selhae have a wider range of natural hair and eye colors, but skin color and other features are very much the same.\nGrowth Rate &amp; Stages\nSelhae are a very long-lived species. They can live upwards of 600-700 years, sometimes even longer if healthy. They age similarly to humans up until around age 20, at which rate their aging slows down. At this rate, roughly every 20-30 years is equivalent to 1 year of a human aging.\nThe point at which a Selhae’s aging slows is when they are considered an “adult”, and there is usually a coming-of-age celebration.\nGenetics &amp; Reproduction\nSelhae are able to reproduce until very late in life, due to their aging slowing down after age 20. Generally speaking, they can reproduce until they are around 400 years old.\nSouls &amp; Magic\nExtended\nGeographic Distribution\nAverage Intelligence\nAverage Physique\nFacial Characteristics and Features\nBody Tint, Coloring and Marking\nSocial Structure\nSapience\nHistory\nNaming Traditions\nMajor Organizations\nBeauty Ideals\nGender Ideals\nCourtship Ideals\nRelationship Ideals\nMajor Language Groups and Dialects\nCommon Etiquette\nCommon Customs and Observed Traditions\nTaboos\nMajor Historical Figures\nInterspecies Relations\nMyths and Legends\nAs the Inna took a very real part in the creation of asilles, the creation mythos tends to be pretty close to reality.\nDescendants of the original Selhae created by Anwi passed down The Story of the Inna. These original Selhae created the clans as they’re known today, and the head/elder of the clans are usually direct descendants of these original Selhae clan heads.\nThe Story of the Inna is taught by the heads of the clans to the children of the clan/settlement, to pass the story on.\nThe Selhae believe that they were gifted the power of Construction to aid in their mission of making the world a worthy place for the Inna to return to. They believe that their duty is to shape the world according to the Inna’s will and prepare it for their eventual return. The Selhae see themselves as caretakers of the world, and they take their role very seriously.\nArt\nSelhae place great value on music and oral storytelling in their culture. These traditions are deeply ingrained in their society and serve to connect the people to their history and to each other.\nOne way in which these stories and tales are preserved is through the use of ballads and music. These ballads and songs are often passed down through the generations, ensuring that the traditions and stories of the Selhae are not lost over time.\nIn addition to ballads and music, the Selhae also use storytelling as a means of teaching and passing on knowledge. Through these oral stories, the Selhae are able to share important lessons and values with younger generations, ensuring that their culture and way of life are preserved for years to come."},"SPECIES/index":{"slug":"SPECIES/index","filePath":"SPECIES/index.md","title":"Species","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"STORY/index":{"slug":"STORY/index","filePath":"STORY/index.md","title":"Story","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"Vault":{"slug":"Vault","filePath":"Vault.md","title":"Vault","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"index":{"slug":"index","filePath":"index.md","title":"Welcome to the Lunatine World Codex!","links":["CONCEPTS/Dust/"],"tags":[],"content":"Thanks for visiting!
