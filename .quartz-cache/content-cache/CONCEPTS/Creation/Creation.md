The act of creating a Soul or Essence out of concentrated Dust. This is an ability that is unique to the Inna.

Selhae can use the power of Construction, which is related to creation in that the user takes a soulpiece from their own soul and combines it with essence to make a Construct, however these are not complete souls being created and thus is a construction rather than a creation.
