## Pure Dust
Pure Dust is dormant dust, not being used for any sort of creation or magic. It lays inert in the universe, until a being uses it for Creation. This is dust in its default state.
When dust is active and part of a being, it will always become either essence or soul. Beings cannot absorb or hold onto pure dust in its inert form.

## Essence
Essence creates things with physical forms, but without magic or souls. It is created from pure dust.

## Souls
Souls give life and sentience using magic. It is created from pure dust, highly compressed. These souls will attach themselves to dust (either in pure form or in the form of essence) and will create a living being.
