[[Core Archetypes#^be1671|Resonator's Soul]]
Kulith’s magic centers around the ability to manipulate sound waves. When controlled and intentional, these powers can be used in benevolent ways such as making music and creating sound barriers for protection. However, due to its powerful and unpredictable nature, it can often be harmful - manipulating enough energy to create powerful blasts and even cause earthquakes. Using their powers in this way drains a lot of energy out of Kulith.
