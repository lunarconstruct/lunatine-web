### Personal history
- grew up in Kohoii her entire life
- was next in line to be the head of the Levenkagaelii
- her mother, Naediia, died in a conflict between Kohoii and Solei
    - this causes her grandmother, Reika to be very protective of Esela especially around outsiders.
- felt overwhelmed by pressure put on her
- spent her free time away from others at her secret spot, which she called her Maeniil
- one day Kulith stumbled into the maeniil, on the run from solei
    - esela helps her hide from solei, but also hides her from reika since she’s very against outsiders
    - the two become very close (gorlfriends)
